1. SUMMARY. [[TENG HSIAO-PING || 1]] TOLD [[CODEL WOLFF ||2 ]] JULY 9 THAT ALTHOUGH [[CHINA|| 3]] WOULD NEVER MAKE A COMMITMENT NOT TO USE FORCE TO RECOVER [[TAIWAN|| 4]], [[PEKING ||3 ]] WOULD "RESPECT REALITIES" AND WOULD DO [[ITS|| 3]] BEST TO "CREATE CONDITIONS TO SOLVE THIS QUESTION BY PEACEFUL MEANS." [[TENG|| 1]] CHARACTERIZED AS "VERY POSITIVE" RECENT REPORTS THAT [[THE US|| 5]] WOULDNOT SELL PLANES TO [[TAIWAN|| 4]], ARGUING THAT SUCH SALES WOULD BLOCK THE CHANCES FOR A PEACEFUL SETTLE- MENT. [[HE|| 1]] REFERRED TO COOPERATION WITH [[THE KMT|| 6 ]] IN THE 20'S AND 30'S AS A POSSIBLE MODE FOR FUTURE SETTLE- MENT OF [[TAIWAN|| 4]]. END SUMMARY.


2. IN A 90-MINUTE MEETING WITH [[CODEL WOLFF ||2 ]] JULY 9, [[VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING || 1]] GAVE AN IN-DEPTH DISCUSSION OF THE [[TAIWAN || 4]] ISSUE. [[HE|| 1]] STATED THAT WITH RESPECT TO [[TAIWAN || 4]], "THE ONLY OBSTACLE BETWEEN [[US||7 ]] ", THERE COULD BE "NO CONCESSION" FROM [[THE PRC || 3]] SINCE "THIS INVOLVES [[OUR|| 3]] OWN SOVEREIGNTY." ALTHOUGH "SOME PEOPLE HOPE THAT [[CHINA|| 3]] WILL UNDERTAKE A COMMITMENT NOT TO USE FORCE," "[[WE|| 3]] CANNOT COMMIT OURSELVES ON THIS QUESTION". SUCH A COMMITMENT, [[HE || 1]] SAID, WOULD OBSTRUCT A SETTLEMENT, INCLUDING A SOLUTION BY PEACEFUL MEANS. [[HE || 1]] REPEATED THE STATEMENT THAT "WHEN AND HOW [[WE || 3]] LIBERATE  [[TAIWAN || 4]] IS [[OUR || 3]] INTERNAL AFFAIR AND NO OTHER COUNTRY CAN POKE ITS NOSE INTO IT".


3. IN SPITE OF THIS REPETITION OF THE WELL KKNOWN [[PRC|| 3]] POSITION, [[TENG || 1]] INDICATED THAT [[HE || 1]] UNDERSTOOD [[AMERICAN || 5]] SENSITIVITIES AND GAVE AN UNUSUALLY POSITIVE APPRAISAL OF THE CHANCES FOR A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF [[TAIWAN || 4]]. [[HE || 1]] STATED THAT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS "NO ROOM FOR FLEXI- BILITY" ON MATTERS OF PRINCIPLE, "AS FOR THE SPECIFIC MODALITIES [[WE || 7]] CAN CONSULT EACH OTHER." [[HE||1]] STATED THAT [[CHINA||3]] WOULD "RESPECT REALITIES AND [[WE || 3]] CAN BE FLEXIBLE IN THE MEANS OF SETTLEMENT", AND THAT "[[I || 1]] AM SURE THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO FIND A SETTLEMENT SATISFACTORY TO ALL". EVEN MORE POSITIVELY, [[HE||1]] DECLARED THAT "[[WE || 3]] WILL DO OUR BEST TO CREATE CONDITIONS TO SOLVE THIS QUESTION BY PEACEFUL MEANS," THE MOST FORTHCOMING FORMULA THAT [[ I|| 2 ]] HAVE YET HEARD USED WITH A [[VISITING [[AMERICAN || 12]] DELEGATION || 8]].


4. [[TENG||1]] ALSO REFERRED TWICE TO PRE-1949 COOPERATION BETWEEN [[THE KMT ||6]] AND [[THE COMMUNISTS || 9]], AND ASKED: "SINCE THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN COOPERATION TWICE WITH [[THE KUOMINTANG ||6]], CAN YOU RULE IT OUT THE THIRD TIME?" ASKED WHETHER THERE WERE PRESENTLY ANY CONTACSTS WITH [[TAIWAN || 4]], [[HE||1]] REPLIED IN THE NEGATIVE, BUT STATED THAT "[[WE||3]] KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE" AND THAT "[[CHIANG CHING-KUO || 10]] WAS [[[[MY || 1]] CLASSMATE || 10]]."


5. ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT ANTI-COMMUNIST FORCES ON [[TAIWAN || 4]] MIGHT TURN TO [[THE SOVIETS || 11]], [[TENG ||1]] ADMITTED THAT [[THEY|| 11]] HAD CONSIDERED THIS QUESTION, BUT FELT THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY BECAUSE OF THE [[MT'S || 6]] HISTORICAL ANTI-[[SOVIET|| 11]] POSITION. EVEN IF IT HAPPENED, [[HE|| 1]] SAID, [[THE CHINESE || 3]] COULD COPE, BECAUSE "[[I || 1]] DON'T THINK [[THE US || 12]] WOULD OPPOSE" THE USE OF FORCE IN SUCH A SITUATION.


6. [[TENG||1]] CHARACTERIZED AS "VERY POSITIVE" NEWS REPORTS THAT [[THE US ||5]] WOULD NOT SELL PLANES TO [[TAIWAN || 4]] AS ORIGINALLY RUMORED AND STATED THAT SUCH WEAPONS SALES WOULD "OBSTRUCT REUNIFICATION NEGOTIATIONS AND SETTLE- MENT BY PEACEFUL MEANS," ADDING THAT "IF PEACEFUL MEANS ARE IMPOSSIBLE THEN ARMED FORCE WILL HAVE TO BE USED." [[HE||1]] DID NOT, HOWEVER, STATE THAT SUCH SALES WOULD BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH NORMALIZATION.


7. AFTER RHETORICALLY ASKINGWHETHER [[THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT|| 12]] WAS BEING MORE ACTIVE ON NORMALIZATION,  [[TENG||1]] SAID THAT [[THE CHINESE|| 3]] WOULD WELCOME MORE ACTIVE [[US || 12]] EFFORTS,ADDING THAT WHAT WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN "DEPENDS ON THE EFFORTS OF [[BOTH SIDES ||7]]." [[HE||1]] EXPRESSED THE BELIEF THAT "[[WE || 3]] AS WELL AS [[YOU||12]] WILL HAVE A MORE ACTIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD SETTLING THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS," NOTING THAT "[[WE || 3]] HAVE THIS DESIRE AND [[WE || 3]] HOPE [[YOU||12]] CAN BE QUICKER.". [[HE||1]] CONCLUDED BY EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR THE EFFORTS OF [[AMERICAN POLITICIANS || 12]] TO ADVANCE NORMALIZATION, BUT SAID "[[WE || 3]] HOPE [[YOU||12]] CAN DO MORE." [[HE||1]] ALSO HOPED "THAT [[[[YOUR || 13]] PRESIDENT || 14]] WILL TAKE MORE RESOLUTE ACTION THAN [[NIXON||15]] DID." THIS , COUPLED WITH THE LACK OF ANY REFERENCE TO [[CHINESE ||16]] PATIENCE OR THE POSSIBILITY OF WAITING 20 OR MORE YEARS, SUGGESTS THAT [[THE CHINESE || 3]] HAVE A GREATER EXPECTATION OF MOVEMENT ON NORMALIZATION THAN WAS VISIBLE A FEW MONTHS AGO.


8. [[TENG||1]] TOOK PAINS TO RELATE NORMALIZATION TO STRATEGIC QUESTIONS, STATING THAT NORMALIZATION WOULD FORCE [[THE SOVIET UNION ||11]] TO ACT MORE CAUTIOUSLY. [[HE||1]] ALSO VOLUN- TEERED THAT [[MOSCOW||11] WAS TRYING TO BLUFF [[THE UNITED STATES || 12]] INTO BELIEVING IN THE POSSIBILITY OF [[SINO || 3]]- [[SOVIET || 11]] RECONCILIATION, BUT THAT THIS WAS JUST A TRICK. IN THE RELATIVELY BRIEF DISCUSSION ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, [[TENG||1]] ALSO EXPRESSED CONSIDERABLE CONCERN ABOUTDEVELOPMENTS IN [[VIETNAM ||17]], WHICH [[HE||1]] DESCRIBED AS [[THE "[[CUBA || 18]] OF THE EAST || 17]]" AND A TOOL IN [[MOSCOW'S || 11]] EFFORTS TO SUBVERT [[ASEAN || 19]]. WHILE [[TENG||1]] [[HIMSELF ||1]] DID NOT DRAW AN EXPLICIT CONNECTION,  [[SOME DELEGATION MEMBERS ||8 ]] REMARKED AFTERWARDS THAT [[THEY ||8 ]] FELT [[PEKING'S ||3]] CONCERN WITH [[VIETNAMESE||17]] DEVELOPMENTS COULD BE CREATING A MORE URGENT INTEREST AMONG [[CHINESE || 12]] IN NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH [[THE US || 5]].
