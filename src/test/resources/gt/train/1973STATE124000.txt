1. HEAVY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN DEMAND FOR [[US ||1]] FERROUS SCRAP HAVE RESULTED IN SHARPLY INCREASED PRICES AND EXPORTS SINCE BEGINNING OF YEAR. FERROUS SCRAP EXPORTS DURING JAN- APRIL 1973 TOTALED 3.5 MILLION TONS ( EXCLUDING SHIPS FOR SCRAPP- ING), VS. 1.8 MILLION TONS IN SAME PERIOD 1972. HEAVY FOREIGN DEMAND FOR [[US ||1]] SCRAP HAS RESULTED IN [[US ||1]] FERROUS SCRAP USERS REQUESTING [[USG ||2]] TO RESTRICT OR EMBARGO SCRAP EX- PORTS. [[DEPARTMENT||3]] UNDERSTANDS THAT SMALLER AND MEDIUM SIZE [[US ||1]] STEEL PRODUCERS ARE SEEKING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PRO- VIDE FOR AUTOMATIC TRIGGERING OF EXPORT LIMITATIONS AND/ OR EMBARGO ONCE COMBINATION OF [[US ||1]] DOMESTIC SCRAP RECEIPTS ( BY USERS) AND EXPORTS REACH PRE- DETERIMINED LEVELS. [[[[AMERICAN ||1]] IRON AND STEEL INSTITUTE ( AISI ||4 ]] -- [[PRINCIPAL [[US ||1]] STEEL INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATION || 4]]), WHICH IN MAY 1973 REQUESTED [[USG ||2]] PLACE 7 MILLION TON LIMIT ON SCRAP EXPORTS THIS YEAR, HAS NOW REQUESTED EMBARGO ON SCRAP EXPORTS, CITING [[PRESI- DENT' S || 5]] RECENT FREEZE ON DOMESTIC PRICES ( WHICH APPLIES TO DOMESTIC SCRAP PRICES, BUT NOT TO EXPORT PRICES).


2. EARLIER THIS YEAR, [[USG ||2]] CONCLUDED THAT [[JAPANESE || 6]] SCRAP PURCHASES CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO PRICE PRESSURES ON [[US ||1]] FERROUS SCRAP MARKET IN DECEMBER 1972, JANUARY, AND EARLY FEBRUARY 1973, WHEN [[JAPANESE || 6]] USERS APPARENTLY PURCHASED HEAVILY FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE USE. DURING THIS TIME [[US ||1]] PRICES ROSE 30 PERCENT. PRICE INCREASES APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY BUNCHING OF [[JAPANESE || 6]] PURCHASES RATHER THAN LEVEL OF EXPORT SHIPMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, [[USG ||2] IN MAY 1973 REQUESTED [[GOJ || 7]] TO URGE [[JAPANESE || 6]] PURCHASERS OF [[US ||1]] FERROUS SCRAP TO SPREAD OUT PURCHASES MORE EVENLY OVER LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. [[GOJ || 7]] SUBSEQUENTLY INFORMED [[US ||2]] THAT [[JAPANESE || 6]] IMPORTS OF FERROUS SCRAP DURING SECOND HALF CY 1973 ESTIMATED TO BE APPROX 24 PERCENT LESS THAN DURING FIRST SIX MONTHS. MAJOR FACTOR IN THIS ESTIMATED REDUC- TION IS INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF PIG IRON IN [[JAPAN||6]] RESULTING FROM RELIGHTING OF PREVIOUSLY IDLE BLAST FURNACES, AND INSTALLATION OF NEW BLAST FURNACES. [[JAPANESE || 6]] ESTIMATED SCRAP IMPORTS FROM [[US ||1]] DURING SECOND HALF YEAR AT 1.95 MILLION NET TONS ( NT) VS. 2.58 MILLION NT DURING FIRST HALF ( [[US ||1]] DATA SHOW JAN- APRIL 1973 FERROUS SCRAP EX- PORTS TO [[JAPAN||6]] TOTALING 1.9 MILLION NT, SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF TOTAL [[US ||1]] SCRAP EXPORTS DURING PERIOD). [[JAPANESE || 6]] QUARTERLY SCRAP IMPORTS FROM [[US ||1]] EXPECTED BE 1.18 MILLION NT IN THIRD QUARTER 1973; 0.77 MILLION NT IN FOURTH QUARTER; AND 0.63 MILLION NT IN FIRST QUARTER 1974. [[JAPANESE || 6]] INDICATED THEY HAD COMPLETED [[US ||1]] SCRAP PURCHASES FOR SHIPMENT THROUGH SEPT 1973, AND STATED THAT WHEN BUYING RESUMED FOR DELIVERY BETWEEN OCT 1973- MARCH 1974, ATTEMPT WOULD BE MADE TO SPREAD PURCHASES EVENLY THROUGH- OUT THE SIX- MONTH PERIOD.


3. ANALYSIS OF PROBLEM INDICATED THAT BUYING PATTERN OF [[JAPANESE || 6]] PURCHASERS WAS PRINCIPAL EXTERNAL CAUSE FOR PRICE INCREASES. IF SIMILAR BUNCHED PURCHASES ARE MADE BY OTHER MAJOR FOREIGN PURCHASERS, [[USG ||2] WILL MAKE SIMILAR APPROACHES TO THEM.


4. [[US ||1]] DATA SHOW EXPORTS 195,000 NT FERROUS SCRAP TO [[TAIWAN  || 8]] IN JAN- APRIL 1973, VS. 97,785 NT DURING COMPARABLE PERIOD 1972.


5. [[EMBASSY || 9]] MAY DRAW ON ABOVE IN RESPONDING TO INQUIRIES CONCERNING [[U. S. || 1]] FERROUS SCRAP SITUATION.
