1. SUMMARY. ON AUG 31, [[FRENCH || 1]] DESCRIBED RECENT BILATERAL DISCUSSION WITH [[SOVIETS || 2]] ON MDW, WDC AND SPECIAL SESSION, WORLD NUF AND ENMOD, AND [[SOVIET OFFICIAL || 2]] GAVE [[US  || 3]] FURTHER DETAISL ON STATUS OF NUF. [[SOVIETS || 2]] ADDED KELLOGG-BRIAND PACT TO SOURCES OF NUF AND PREDICTED DIFFICULTIES IN PRESENTING ENMOD DRAFT TO [[UNGA || 4]]. END SUMMARY.


2. AT QP MEETING AUG 31, [[[[FRENCH  || 1]] CHARGE HUSSON  || 5]] REPORTED THAT DURING REGULAR BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS ON [[UNGA ||4]] TOPICS WHICH TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK BETWEEN [[[[SOVIET  || 2]] [[MFA IO DIVISION || 7]] DIRECTOR ISRAELYAN  || 6]] AND [[QUAI [[UN|| 8]] DIRECTOR SAINT-LEGER || 9]], [[SOVIETS || 2]] HAD ASKED FOR [[FRENCH ||1]] ON A WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (MDW) RESOLUTION, THE WORLD DISARMAMENT CONFERENCE (WDC) AND ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATION (ENMOD).


3. ON MDW, [[HUSSON || 5]] REPORTED, [[FRENCH ||1]] HAD POINTED OUT TO [[SOVIETS || 2]] [[THEY|| 1]] WERE NOT PRESENT AT RECENT DISCUSSIONS IN [[GENEVA || 10]], AND WOULD HAVE TO STUDY DEFINITION OF WHAT IS INVOLVED IN [[SOVIET || 2]] INITIATIVE WHICH [[SOVIETS || 2]] HAD PRESEN- TED [[THERE || 10]].


4. ON WDC (AND PROPOSED [[UN  || 8]] SPECIAL SESSION ON DISARMAMENT), [[FRENCH ||1]] HAD TOLD [[SOVIETS || 2]] [[THEY || 1]] DO NOT SEE ANY NEED FOR A SPECIAL SESSION. [[SOVIET  || 2]] RESPONSE WAS THAT THERE ARE INDEED PROBLEMS, THAT PROSPECTS ARE "NOT EASY", AND THAT MATTER WOULD HAVE TO BE STUDIED.


5. ON THE WORLD NUF TEXT, [[SOVIETS || 2]] HAD REFERRED TO THE KELLOGG-BRIAND PACT AS A GOOD PRECEDENT. [[FRENCH ||1]] HAD REPLIED THAT NON-USE OF FORCE IS MENTIONED IN MANY OTHER INTERNATIONAL DOCUMENTS, AND THAT THE KELLOGG- BRIAN EXCAMPLE IS NOT IMPRESSIVE, BUT THAT [[THEY || 1]] ARE READY TO LISTEN TO [[SOVIET || 2]] IDEAS.


6. ON ENMOD, [[THE SOVIETS ||2]] HAD SAID [[THEY || 2]] HAD HOPED IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PRESENT AN AGREED DRAFT TREATY TO [[UNGA || 4]], BUT THAT DIFFICULTIES HAD ARISEN WHICH MIGHT PREVENT THIS. [[FRENCH ||1]] HAD REPLIED THAT [[THEY || 1]] ARE PREPARED TO EXAMINE A FINAL TEXT IN A POSITIVE LIGHT, BUT WERE UNALBE TO MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS UNTIL [[THEY || 1]] HAD SEEN ONE.


7. IN CONVERSATION WITH [[EMBOFF  || 12]] AUG 31, [[IO DIVISION COUNSELOR || 11]], [[IGOR' PALENYKH  || 11]] SAID THAT NFUF MATTER WAS STILL UNDER STUDY IN [[MFA ||7]] AND THAT "NO DECISIONS" HAD BEEN TAKEN ON WHAT TO DO WITH ISSUE IN [[UNGA || 4]]. [[HE|| 11]] CITED, SOMEWHAT OBLIQUELY, [[BREZHNEV'S ||13]] 25TH [[PARTY CONGRESS ||15 ]] SPEECH AS THE CUASE OF THE PRESENT [[MFA ||7]] EXAMINATION OF THE ISSUE. WHILE PRAISING THE [[UN||8]] CHARTER AND [[HELSINKI || 14]] FINAL ACT AS CLEAR STATEMENTS OF NUF PRINCIPLE, [[HE||11]] CONSIDERED THEM WEAK COMMITMENTS AND SAID THAT [[THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT  || 2]] BELIEVES THAT NUF PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE "GIVEN THE FORCE OF LAW" WHICH COULD ONLY COME THROUGH A "TREATY". [[HE || 11]] WAS SURE THAT [[THE SOVIETS || 2]] WOULD NOT BE INTERESTED IN JUST ANOTHER [[UNGA || 4]] RESOLUTION.


8. COMMENT: CONVERSATIONS WITH [[TIMERBAYEV ||16]] (REF B), [[ISRAELYAN||6]] AND [[PALENYKH ||11]] SEEM TO POINT STRONGLY TO SOME KIND OF [[SOVIET ||2]] INITIATIVE IN THIS [[UNGA || 4]] ON NUF. HOW- EVER, [[PALENYKH'S ||11]] COMMENTS ABOUT LACK OF DECISION AND [[ISRAAELYAN'S ||6]] APPARENT FAILURE TO REQUEST [[FRENCH ||1]] SUPPORT FOR A SPECIFIC [[SOVIET ||2]] MOVE SUGGEST THAT [[SOVIET ||2]] PLANS ARE NO MORE DECIDED NOW THAN WHEN [[TEMERBAYEV ||16]] TALKED TO [[BRITS || 17]] TWO WEEK AGO. NEVERTHELESS, THE FACT [[THEY || 2]] ARE DISCUSSING MATTER WITH [[WESTERN POWERS  || 18]] SHOWS THAT [[THEY || 2]] PROBABLY ARE DECIDED TO MAKE SOME MOVE, IF ONLY TO KEEP [[BREZHNEV'S  ||13]] SPEECH FROM LOOKING LIKE EMPTY RHETORIC. WITH RESPECT TO [[ ISRAELYAN'S  || 6]] EXPECTATION OF ENMOD PROBLEMS, [[WE  ||3 ]] WILL ATTEMPT TO GET MORE SPECIFIC READING AND DEGREE OF DIFFICULTIES [[SOVIET ||2]] EXPECT.
