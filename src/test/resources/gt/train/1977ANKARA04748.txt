1. REACTION TO [[PRESIDENT KORUTURK'S || 1]] DECISION TO APPROVE [[[[PRIMIN ECEVIT'S || 2]] NEW GOVERNMENT || 3]] IS DEEPLY DIVIDED. MOST OF THE PRESS, WHICH IS GENERALLY SYMPATHETIC TO [[ECEVIT || 2]] AND HAD BEEN ARGUING THAT THE ONLY LOGICAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE A ONE-PARTY GOVERNMENT LED BY [[ECEVIT || 2]], HAS APPLAUDED [[KORUTURK'S || 1]] DECISION. [[FORMER PRIMIN DEMIREL || 4]], [[[[NATIONAL SALVATION PARTY (NSP) || 5]] CHAIRMAN ERBAKAN || 6]], [[[[NATIONALIST ACTION PARTY (NAP) || 7]] CHAIRMAN TURKES || 8]] AND THE CONSERVATIVE PRESS HAVE REACTED WITH ANGER. ACCORIDING TO THE PRESS, [[DEMIREL || 4]] REFUSED TO RECEIVE A TELEPHONE CALL FROM [[ECEVIT || 2]] MID-AFTERNOON. IN EXPLANATION [[DEMIREL || 4]] LEFT AN UNSINGED NOTE ON [[HIS ||2]] DESK SAYING THAT [[HE||4]] HAD CONSISTENCTLY OPPOSED THE FORMATION OF A GOVERNMENT WHCIH COULD NOT WIN A VOTE OF DONFIDENCE AND THEREFORE [[HE||4]] FELT NO NECESSITY TO SPEAK TO [[HE HEAD OF [[THAT GOVERNMENT ||3]] || 2]]. [[TH JP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE || 10]] SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED A STATEMENT CALLING [[THE PRESIDENT'S ||1 ]] ACTION INCOMPATIBLE WITH DEMOCRATIC PARLIAMENTARY PRINCIPLES. THE STATEMENT ASSERTED THAT NO ONE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO GIVE [[ECEVIT || 2]] THE POWER WHICH [[HE|| 2]] HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO WIN IN THE ELECTIONS. IN CONCLUSION, THE STATEMENT EXPRESSED CONFIDENCE THAT [[PARLIAMENT || 11]] WOULD REJECT [[THE [[ECEVIT || 2]] GOVERNMENT || 3]] AND THAT " IN THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE TIME, [[THE GOVERNMENTS OF [[CANKAYA || 9]] || 3]] (THE LOCATION OF THE [[PRESIDENT'S|| 1]] PALACE) WIL BE REPLACED BY [[GOVERNMENTS OF [[THE PARLIAMENT || 11]] ||3]]."


2. [[[[THE NSP || 5]] EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ||12 ]] ALSO RELEASED A STATEMENT CLAIMING THE CONSTITUTION HAD BEEN FLAGRANTLY VIOLATED BY THE [[PRESIDENT'S|| 1]] DECISION. [[THE NSP || 5]] ALSO SAID THAT NOT ONLY WAS THE [[PRESIDENT'S|| 1]] ACTION IMPROPER BUT THE ACTIONS OF [[THE NEW GOVERNMENT || 3]] WOULD ALSO BE ILLEGITIMATE.


3. [[[[NAP ||7]] CHAIRMAN TURKES || 8]] TOLD THE PRESS IT WAS WRONG FOR [[THE PRESIDENT || 1]] TO HAVE ENDORSED [[THE [[ECEVIT || 2]] GOVERNMENT || 3]] WHICH HAD BEEN FORMED IN CONTRAVENTION OF DEMOCRATIC TRADITION. [[TURKES || 8]] SAID THAT THE GENEROUS TREATMENT [[THE PRESIDENT ||1]] HAD BESTOWED UPON [[ECEVIT || 2]] WAS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE IMPARTIALITY WITH WHICH [[HE ||1]] HAD TREATED [[THE NATIONALIST FRONT GOVERNMENT || 3]].


4. [[ECEVIT || 2]] TOLD [[HIS || 2]] PARLIAMENTARY GROUP MORNING OF JUNE 21 (PRIOR TO THE MEETING WITH [[PRESIDENT KORUTURK  || 1]] AT WHICH [[HIS || 2]] GOVERNMENT WAS APPROVED) THAT [[HE  || 2]] HAD NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ALL OF THE SUPPORT NEEDED FOR A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, BU THAT  [[HE || 2]] WAS HOPEFUL THAT [[HE || 2]] COULD DO SO. REGARDLES, [[HE || 2]] SAID, ALTHOUGH [[THE JP ||13]], [[THE NSP ||5]] AND [[THE NAP ||7]] COMBINED POSSESSED ENOUGH VOTES TO KEEP [[[[HIS || 2]] GOVERNMENT|| 3]] FROM GAINING A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, THIS UNITY WAS A NEGATIVE UNITY, NOT A POSITIVE ONE. [[HE || 2]] THEREFORE DID NOT BELIEVE [[THOSE THREE PARTIES || 14]] COULD COME AS CLOSE TO FORMING A GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD WIN A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE AS [[HE || 2]] COULD.


5. [[ECEVIT || 2]] HELD [[HIS|| 2]] FIRST [[CABINET || 18]] MEETING EVENING OF JUNE 21. AT THE MEETING [[ECEVIT || 2]] SAID THAT THE PRIORITY TASK OF [[[[HIS || 2]] GOVERNMENT|| 3]] WOULD BE TO RESTORE DOMESTIC PEACE. IN THAT REGARD, A MEETING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR TODAY OF THE INTERESTED [[CABINET MEMBERS || 18]] UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF [[MINISTER OF STATE ORHAN EYUBOGLU || 15]].


6. COMMENT: WITH THE INSTALLATION OF [[THE [[ECEVIT || 2]] GOVERNMENT ||3]], [[TURKEY'S || 16]] DOMESTIC POLITICAL CRISIS HAS PASSED FROM ONE STAGE TO ANOTHER, BUT IS NOT NECESSARILY ANY CLOSER TO SOLUTION. THE BITTERNESS OF THE ATTACKS ON [[PRESIDENT KORUTURK || 1]] IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE HERETOFORE [[KORUTURK || 1]] HAS MANAGED TO MAINTAIN [[HIMSELF  || 1]] ABOVE PARTISAN STRIFE AND HAS BEEN A SYMBOL OF [[NATIONAL || 3]] UNITY. THE CHALLENGE TO THE LEGALITY OF [[HIS || 1]] ACTIONS, IF FOLLOWED BY EFFECTIVE PARTY DISCIPLINE IN [[THE JP ||13]], [[THE NSP ||5]] AND [[THE NAP ||7]] AND A DEFEAT OF [[THE [[ECEVIT || 2]] GOVERNMENT ||3 ]] ON THE VOTE OF CONFIDENCE, [[PRESIDENT KORUTURK ||1]] IS A PROUD AND CONSCIENTIOUS MAN AND [[HE||1]] COULD WELL REACT BY RESIGNING (AS [[HE ||1]] HAS THREATENED TO DO IN REACTION TO LESS IMPORTANT CHALLENGES IN THE PAST).


7. AT THIS POINT, IT IS IMPOSIBLE TO PREDICT WHETHER [[PRIMIN ECEVIT || 2]] WILL BE ABLE TO WIN A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE. THE NEXT TEN DAYS WILL BE FILLED WITH POLITICAL MANEUVERING AND RUMORS OF EVERY SORT OF ATTEMPT TO PRESSURE VARIOUS DEPUTIES TO VOTE ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IN THE END, [[ECEVIT || 2]] (AND APPARENTLY [[PRESIDENT KORUTURK||1]]) HOPES THAT A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF DEPUTIES FROM THE OPPOSITION PARTIES WILL BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE THEIR SHORT TERM POLITICAL INTERESTS, FORMING WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE THE GREATER [[NATIONAL || 3]] INTEREST, IN AN EFFECTIVE [[GOVERNMENT ||3]] AT THIS CRUCIAL PERIOD.
