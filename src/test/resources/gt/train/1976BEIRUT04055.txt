1. FOLLOWING [[MY || 1 ]] MEETING WITH [[PRESIDENT FRANGIE  || 2]] ON MAY 6TH [[I  || 1]] HAD A GENERAL MEETING WITH [[CHRISTIAN LEADERS || 3]], WHEN [[FRANGIE || 2]] WAS JOINED BY [[CHAMOUN || 4]], [[GEMAYEL || 5]] AND [[FATHER KASSIS || 6]].[[ I || 1]] WENT OVER THE SAME GROUND JUST COVERED WITH [[FRANGIE || 2]] AND AGAIN ELICITED GENERAL DISSATISFACTION THAT [[WE || 7]] HAD NO SPECIFIC PLAN AND WERE ALLEGEDLY BLOCKING [[SYRIA || 8]] FROM PROVIDING THE SECURITY NEEDED FOR [[THE COUNTRY'S || 9]] CONTINUED EXISTENCE.


2. [[CHAMOUN || 4]] BEGAN THE DISCUSSION BY NOTING THAT [[LEBANESE || 9]] DIFFICULTIES COULD BE ATTRIBUTED MAINLY TO [[THE PALES- TINIANS || 12]]. [[HE || 4]] WAS PLEASED THAT [[I  || 1]] HAD CONCEDED THAT THE [[PALESTINIAN  || 12]] PRESENCE HAD CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOCAL DIFFICULTIES. [[THE CHRISTIANS IN [[LEBANON || 9]]  || 10]] HAD BEEN ATTACKED. [[THEIR||10]] VERY EXISTENCE HAD BEEN THREATENED. [[THEY || 10]] WERE PREPARED TO FIGHT ON IF NECESSARY. [[THE COMMUNISTS  || 11]] HAVE BEEN FISHING IN TROUBLED WATERS AND HAD AGGRAVATED THE SITUATION. OTHER COUNTRIES HAD BEEN THREATENED AND [[THE UNITED NATIONS|| 13]] INTERVENED. IT WAS INEXCUSABLE THAT [[THE UNITED NATIONS || 13]] NOT INTERVENE IN THE PRESENT SITUATION IN [[LEBANON|| 9]]. [[LEBANON || 9]] WAS GOING UP IN FLAMES WHILE [[THE WESTERN CIVILIZED WORLD || 14]] WAS SITTING ON [[ITS|| 14]] HANDS. THERE WOULD BE NO SOLUTION IN [[LEBANON|| 9]] UNTIL A [[MIDDLE EAST|| 15]] SETTLEMENT WAS REACHED. THIS WAS DELAYED NOT ONLY BY THE ELECTIONS IN [[THE UNITED STATES || 16]] BUT ALSO BY THE [[ISRAELI || 17]] ELECTIONS THE FOLLOWING YEAR. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, ALTHOUGH [[CHAMOUN || 4]] STRESSED THE NECESSITY OF GETTING [[THE UNITED NATIONS || 13]] INTO THE ACT, [[HE || 4]] LATER REMARKED THAT NO [[LEBANESE  PRIME MINISTER ||18]] (ALWAYS A [[MOSLEM || 19]] ) WOULD ASK [[THE UNITED NATIONS  || 13]] TO INTERVENE.


3. [[PIERRE GEYMAYEL  || 5]] THEN EXPRESSED [[HIS || 5]]  GRAVE DISCOURAGEMENT. [[HE || 5]]  TOO SAW CONSIDERABLE [[COMMUNIST || 11]]  ACTIVITY IN [[LEBANON || 9]]  AIMED AT DESTROYING [[THE COUNTRY || 9]] . ON THE OTHER HAND, MOST OF THE PROBLEMS COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO [[THE PALESTINIANS||12]]. HE DID NOT WISH TO LECTURE [[THE WESTERN COUNTRIES  || 14]] BUT [[HE  || 5]] WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT SECURITY IN [[LEBANON || 9]]  WAS THE MAJOR ISSUE. WITHOUT SECURITY THERE WAS NO POINT IN DISCUSSING RECONSTRUCTION. ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO INTEREST [[THE UNITED NATIONS  || 13]] IN [[LEBANON || 9]]  BUT THESE WERE UNSUCCESS- FUL. [[SYRIA || 8]] , HOWEVER, WAS PREPARED TO PROVIDE THE SECURITY THAT [[THE UNITED NATIONS || 13]]  WAS UNABLE TO PROVIDE. FOR TWENTY YEARS [[[[HIS||5]]  PARTY || 20]] HAD BEEN ACTIVELY OPPOSED TO [[SYRIA ||8]]. [[HE || 5]] WAS NOW CONVINCED OF [[SYRIAN || 8]] GOOD INTEN- TIONS. IN ANY EVENT, [[LEBANON ||9]] HAD NO ONE ELSE TO TURN TO SO [[THEY||9]]  HAD TO COUNT ON [[THE SYRIANS||8]] AND WERE PREPARED TO DO SO. UNFORTUNATELY, [[THE UNITED STATES || 7]], WHILE NOT IN A POSITION TO PROVIDE DIRECT ASSISTANCE IN THE SECURITY FIELD, WAS ALSO PREVENTING [[SYRIA||8]] FROM DOING SO. [[HE|| 5]] APPEALED TO [[THE UNITED STATES  || 7]] TO GIVE THE GREEN LIGHT TO [[SYRIA || 8]]. REFERRING TO THE PRESENT DELAYS IN THE ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT, [[GEMAYEL || 5]] RECALLED THAT [[HE|| 5]] HAD STRONGLY URGED [[PRESIDENT FRANGIE  || 2]] NOT TO CONTRIBUTE TO DELAYS AND TO SIGN THE AMENDMENT ALLOWING FOR NEW PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. IN LIGHT OF WHAT HAD TRANSPIRED SINCE THEN [[HE|| 5]] FELT ASHAMED.


4. [[FATHER KASSIS || 6]]  THEN MADE COMMENTS OF [[HIS OWN || 6]]. START- ING OUT BY NOTING THAT [[HE || 6]] WAS SPEAKING IN THE NAME OF THE CHURCH, [[HE || 6]] SAID THAT ONE HAD TO LIVE BEFORE ONE COULD PHILOSOPHIZE. [[HE || 6]]  THOUGHT THAT [[ LEBANON || 9]] HAD PERHAPS CHOSEN THE WRONG FRIENDS. IT WAS PREFERABLE TO BE A LIVE [[COMMUNIST || 11]] THAN A DEAD [[DEMOCRAT || 21]]. [[THE SOVIET UNION  || 22]] HAD COME TO THE AID OF THOSE WHO SOUGHT [[ITS ||22 ]] HELP IN [[ANGOLA || 23]]. PERHAPS THE TIME HAD COME FOR [[THE [[LEBANESE || 9]] CHRISTIANS || 10]] TO SEEK THE AID OF [[THE SOVIET UNION  ||22 ]] AND BECOME A [[COMMUNIST  || 11]] STATE. INDEED, [[LEBANON  || 9]] COULD NOT ONLY BECOME A [[COMMUNIST  || 11]] STATE, BUT [[IT || 9]] COULD ALSO HELP SPREAD [[SOVIET  || 22]] DOCTRINE IN THE AREA. [[KASSIS'  || 6]] STATEMENT WAS SO STRONG THAT EVEN [[PRESIDENT FRANGIE  || 2]] INTERVENED TO SAY THAT [[HE || 2]] DID NOT SHARE THESE VIEWS. ON THE OTHER HAND, [[KASSIS|| 6]], WHETHER WANTING TO EXPRESS [[HIS || 6]] GENUINE FEELINGS OR MERELY DESIRING TO GET BACK INTO THE GOOD GRACES OF  [[HIS  || 6]] OWN AUDIENCE, REMARKED THAT [[HE || 6]]  HAD IN MIND SEEKING [[SOVIET || 22]] ASSISTANCE IN THE SAME WAY [[THE EGYPTIANS  || 24]] HAD SOUGHT IT. ONCE ORDER WAS RESTORED, [[LEBANON  || 9]] COULD THROW [[THE SOVIETS  || 22]] OUT IN THE SAME WAY THAT [[THE EGYPTIANS || 24]] HAD DONE SO.


5. AT THE END OF THE MEETING [[LUCIEN DAHDAH || 25]] TRIED TO MAKE SOME SUMMARIES. AS [[HE  || 25]] SAW THE SITUATION, THREE ALTERNATIVES WERE POSSIBLE. THE FIRST ALTERNATIVE INVOLVED SOME SORT OF [[SYRIAN  || 8]]-[[U.S  || 7]]. AGREEMENT. THIS COULD BE FOLLOWED BY A [[U.S.  || 7]]-[[USSR  || 22]] AGREEMENT GUARANTEEING THE EXISTENCE OF [[THE PALESTINIANS  || 12]] IN [[LEBANON  || 9]] UNTIL IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO HAVE A STATE OF [[THEIR  || 12]] OWN, WHICH EACH FAVORED. A FOUR COUNTRY CONSORTIUM COULD BE PUT TOGETHER TO ASSURE THE RECONSTRUCTION OF [[LEBANON  || 9]]. THE SECOND ALTERNATIVE WOULD INVOLVE A SITUATION WHERE [[LEBANON  || 9]] WOULD HAVE TO GO IT ON [[ITS  || 9]] OWN WITH THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE. THIS WOULD INVOLVE ELECTING A PRESIDENT AND TRYING TO PROVIDING SUFFICIENT SECURITY FOR A GOVERNMENT TO BE FORMED AND [[THE COUNTRY  || 9]] TO GET BACK ON THE ROAD TO RESTORATION. THE THIRD ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE PARTITION.


6. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT, WHILE [[I   || 1]] HAD MADE ARRANGE- MENTS TO SPEAK TO EACH OF THE PRINCIPAL [[CHRISTIAN LEADERS || 3]] SEPARATELY, THESE ARRANGEMENTS WERE IGNORED, SO THAT  [[I  || 1]] ENDED UP SPEAKING TO [[THE GROUP || 3]] TOGETHER. THIS WAS PROBABLY AS A RESULT OF A LITTLE SKULL- DUDGERY ON THE PART OF [[LUCIEN DAHDAH || 25]]. IN COLLABORATION WITH [[FRANGIE || 2]]. [[I || 1]] DID HAVE A PARTICULAR MESSAGE TO DELIVER TO [[PIERRE GEMAYEL ||5 ]] ON DIALOGUE AND WAS AT LEAST ABLE TO DO THAT AS THE RESULT OF A MINUTE OR TWO WITH [[GEMAYEL || 5]] ALONE AFTER THE MEETING (SEE SEPTEL.)
