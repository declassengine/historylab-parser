1. [[AMCIT ARNOLD OZOLINS, SR. || 1]] INFORMED [[CONSOFF || 2]] BY TELEPHONE DECEMBER 3 THAT [[HE  || 1]] RECEIVED LETTER FROM [[[[RIGA || 3]] [[OVIR || 4]] DIRECTOR || 5]] NOV 30 STATING THAT [[HIS || 1]] APPLICATION FOR [[SOVIET || 6]] EXIT PERMISSION HAS BEEN REFUSED ONCE AGAIN. AS CUSTOMARY, [[[[OVIR || 4]] DIRECTOR  || 5]] GAVE NO REASON FOR REFUSAL TO [[OZOLINS || 1]], WHO HAS BEEN ENDEAVORING RETURN TO WIFE, SON AND STEP-DAUGHTERS IN [[US || 7]] SINCE SHORTLY AFTER [[HIS || 1]] ARRIVAL IN 1961 TO VISIT AILING MOTHER (WHO SINCE PASSED AWAY).


2. COMMENT. DURING CALL ON [[[[RIGA || 3]] [[OVIR || 4]] DIRECTOR  KAIJA || 5]] OCT 11 [[[[MOSCOW  || 8]] AND [[LENINGRAD || 8]] CONSOFFS  || 9]] PRESENTED LIST OF [[LATVIAN || 3]] CASES ON [[USG  || 10]] REPRESENTATION LIST XV AND PLACED PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON [[OZOLINS || 1]] ([[MOSCOW || 6]] 12671, PARA 3). ALTHOUGH [[[[OVIR || 4]] DIRECTOR  ||4 ]] TOLD [[ CONSOFFS  || 9]] [[OZOLINS  || 1]] CASE WOULD BE "CONSIDERED," [[HE  || 5]] HAS INFORMED [[OZOLINS || 1]] ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT POSITIVE DECI- SION IN [[HIS || 1]] CASE CAN COME ONLY "FROM [[MOSCOW || 8]]." IT APPEARS TO [[EMBASSY || 11]], TOO, THAT MOST AMCIT REPATRIATION AND OTHER [[USG  ||10 ]] FAMILY REUNIFICATION CASES WILL BE RESOLVED ONLY THROUGH CENTRALLY MADE [[SOVIET GOVT ||8 ]] DECISION. [[EMBASSY || 11]] HOPES THAT RECENT HIGH LEVEL [[USG || 10]] REPRESENTATIONS ON EIGHT PENDING AMCIT CASES ([[MATLOCK ||12 ]] AND [[DUBS || 2]] TO [[KORNIYENKO || 13]], [[MOSCOW || 6]] 14507; [[ARMITAGE || 14]] TO [[VORONTSOV || 15]], [[STATE || 16]] 198580) SOON WILL PRODUCT SIGN OF POSITIVE MOVEMENT. IF SUCH SIGN NOT FORTHCOMING, HOWEVER, [[WE || 11]] SEE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE THAN TO PRESS THIS HUMANITARIAN PROBLEM ON STILL HIGHER LEVEL.
