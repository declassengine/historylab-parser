1. IN FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MATTER RAISED REF. (A), [[PERMREP||15]] SHOULD INFORM [[AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ||1]] THAT [[WE||2]] CONTINUE TO BE VERY CONCERNED OVER TREND TO POLITICIZE [[UNESCO||3]] ACTIVITIES, [[WE||11]] INTEND IN [[OUR||11]] PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AND DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK AGAINST THIS TENDENCY, TO CALL ATTENTION TO DOUBLE STANDARDS, AND TO ENCOURAGE STRICT ADHERENCE TO [[UNESCO'S||3]] TECHNICAL MISSION AS DESCRIBED IN [[ITS||3]] CONSTITUTION. [[WE ||11]] WILL, OF COURSE, ALWAYS STAND FOR FAIR PLAY, EVENHANDEDNESS, AND FOR AFFORDING FULL OPPORTUNITY TO [[CHILE||4]] OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND [[ITS||4]] POSITION. IN THIS CONNECTION [[WE||11]] ARE PREPARED TO SUPPORT INCLUSION IN THE AGENDA OF THE 97TH [[[[UNESCO||3]] EXECUTIVE BOARD||6]] OF ITEM PROPOSED BY [[CHILE||4]] CONCERNING [[ITS||4]] PROTEST OVER PROCEDURES FOLLOWED IN REACHING PREVIOUS DECISIONS RELATING TO [[CHILE||4]]. [[PERMREP||15]] SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT POSITIONS TAKEN BY OTHER [[LATIN AMERICAN STATES||5]] REPRESENTED ON [[THE EXECUTIVE BOARD||6]] WILL BE IMPORTANT WITH RESPECT TO PROPOSALS WHICH UNFRIENDLY GOVERNMENTS MAY BE PLANNING TO MAKE.


2. [[DEPT||2]] NOTES FROM PROVISIONAL AGENDA THAT PROPOSALS CONCERNING [[CHILE||3]] COULD BE PUT FORWARD EITHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE REPORT OF [[THE COMMITTEE ON CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN EDUCATION||12]] OR IN CONNECTION WITH ITEM ON STATE OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE, CULTURE AND INFORMATION IN  [[CHILE||7]], WHICH IS TO FEATURE A REPORT BY [[THE DIRECTOR GENERAL||16]]. WHILE [[WE||11]] MUST RESERVE [[OUR||11]] FINAL POSITION UNTIL [[WE||11]] KNOW THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSALS WHICH MAY BE MADE, [[PERMREP||15]] SHOULD INDICATE TO [[AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ||1]] [[OUR||11]] THINKING THAT IT MAY BE TACTICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO RELATE ANY PROPOSALS FOR ACTION BY [[UNESCO||3]] TO [[THE AD HOC WORKING GROUP||10]] WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY [[THE UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION||8]] AT [[ITS||8]] 1975 SESSION EARLIER THIS YEAR. [[THIS GROUP||10]], WHICH HAS THE MANDATE TO INQUIRE INTO THE PRESENT SITUATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN [[CHILE||7]]  ON THE BASIS OF PREVIOUS [[UN||9]] RESOLUTIONS, OF A VISIT TO [[CHILE||7]], AND "OF ORAL AND WRITTEN EVIDENCE TO BE GATHERED FROM ALL RELEVANT SOURCES," HAS BEEN PROMISED THE COOPERATION OF [[THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT||4]]. IF IT DEVELOPS THAT ALLEGATIONS ARE MADE AGAINST [[CHILE||4]]  IN [[THE EXECUTIVE BOARD||6]] WHICH MAY BE DEEMED TO FALL WITHIN THE MANDATE OF [[THE AD HOC WORKING GROUP||10]] , [[[[UNESCO||3]] EXECUTIVE BOARD||6]] COULD REFER ALLEGATIONS TO [[THE [[UN||9]] AD HOC WORKING GROUP||10]] FOR INQUIRY AS A PART OF [[ITS||10]] GENERAL MANDATE. FURTHER [[EXECUTIVE BOARD||6]] ACTION WOULD AWAIT COMPLETION OF REPORT BY [[[[UN||9]] WORKING GROUP||10]] .


3. RE [[OUR||11]] POSITION ON [[COMMITTEE DEALING WITH COMMUNICA- TIONS||13]] RAISED REF.(B), AGREE THAT SINCE [[US||11]] NO LONGER MEMBER OF [[COMMITTEE||13]] [[PERMDEL||17]] WOULD HAVE NO BASIS FOR INVOLVEMENT THIS ISSUE PRIOR TO PRESENTATION OF PROPOSALS FOR ACTION BY [[EXECUTIVE BOARD || 6]]. AS CONCERNS [[OUR||11]] STAND WHEN MATTER REACHES [[EXECUTIVE BOARD ITSELF||6]], [[OUR||11]] POSITION WILL DEPEND UPON NATURE OF ANY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WHICH MAY BE PUT FORWARD ON BASIS OF [[COMMITTEE'S||13]] CONCLUSIONS. HOWEVER, IF TACTIC DESCRIBED IN PARA 2 ABOVE APPEALS TO [[CHILEANS||4]] [[THEY||4]] MIGHT WISH TO GET FRIENDLY MEMBERS OF [[COMMITTEE||13]] TO WORK IN DIRECTION OF REFERRAL OF COMPLAINTS TO [[[[HRC||8]] WORKING GROUP||10]].


4. FYI. [[DEPT||2]] DOES NOT DESIRE THAT [[WE||11]] ASSUME POSTURE IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AS DEFENDER OF [[CHILEAN GOVERNMENT||4]]. [[OUR||11]] OPINIONS ON DEPOLITICIZATION, EVENHANDEDNESS AND FAIR PLAY MUST BE EXPRESSED IN GENERAL TERMS AS APPLYING ACROSS [[THE BOARD||6]], REGARDLESS OF THE IDENTITY OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH MAY BE INVOLVED. THESE CONSIDERATIONS MAY ON SOME FUTURE OCCASION APPLY TO THOSE WHO NOW WOULD IGNORE THEM IN THE [[CHILEAN||4]]  CASE.


END FYI.


[[KISSINGER || 14]]
