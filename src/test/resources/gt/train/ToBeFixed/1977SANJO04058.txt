1. [[EMBOFF || 1]] DISCUSSED FORTHCOMING [[UNCTAD ||  2]] [[COMMON FUND || 3]] MEETING WITH [[FONMIN DIRECTOR OF FOREIGN POLICY MARTA QUIROS || 4]] ON AUGUST 31 DRAWING ON TALKING POINTS CONTAINED IN REFTEL. IN RESPONSE TO QUERY ABOUT [[GOCR  || 5]] VIEWS, [[QUIROS || 4]] STATED THAT [[MINISTRY || 12]] HAD BEEN RECEIVING REPORTS ON ISSUE FROM [[[[COSTA RICAN || 5]] AMBASSADOR IN [[GENEVA ||6 ]] || 7]] BUT HAD NOT YET FORMULATED POSITION. [[QUIROS || 4]] RECALLED BRIEFING OF [[FONMIN FACIO ||11 ]] BY [[[[ NSC  || 8]] OFFICIAL ROBERT HORMATS|| 9]] DURING RECENT VISIT BY [[AMBASSADOR YOUNG ||10 ]] AND ADDED THAT [[FACIO HIMSELF || 11]] EYCLD PLAY LARGE ROLE IN FORMULATING AND APPROVING [[GOCR || 5]] POSITION.


2. IN RESPONSE TO [[EMBOFF'S || 1]] QUESTION ABOUT COMPOSITION OF DELE- GATION,  [[QUIROS || 4]] STATED THAT IT MIGHT BE DRAWN SOLELY FROM [[[[GOCR  || 5]]  GENEVA MISSION || 21]] WITH NO REPRESENTATIVES SENT FROM [[CAPITAL || 19]] . (FYI [[FERNANDO NARANJO || 13]] WHO WAS SENT AS [[CHIEF OF [[GOCR || 5 [[DELEGATION TO 1976 [[UNCTAD || 2]] IV [[NAIROBI || 15]] CONFERENCE || 14]] || 13]] IS NOW [[HEAD OF [[SOCIAL SECURITY INST- ITUTE || 16]] || 13]] BUT RETAINS RANK OF MINISTER (DEVELOPMENT ADVISOR) IN [[CASA PRESIDENCIAL || 17]]  AND REMAINS INFLUENTIAL IN POLICY FORMULATION RE [[COMMODITIES AND COMMON FUND || 3]]. END FYI)


3. [[EMBASSY ||18]] DOES NOT BELIEVE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT WOULD RESULT FROM ANOTHER VISIT BY [[US || 20]] EXPERT ON [[COMMON FUND || 3]]. AS NOTED IN PARA 1, [[[[ NSC  || 8]] OFFICIAL HORMATS || 9]] GAVE EXCELLENT BRIEFING TO [[FONMIN FACIO ||11 ]], [[FERNANDO NARANJO ||13]] AND OTHER APPROPRIATE [[GOCR OFFICIALS || 5]] ON AUGUST 9, 1977. AS A RESULT OF THIS BRIEFING, [[EMBASSY ||18]] BELIEVES BOTH [[FACIO ||11 ]] AND [[NARANJO ||13]], AS WELL AS  [[QUIROS || 4]], ARE FAVORABLY DISPOSED TO BROAD OUTLINES OF [[USG ||20]] POSITION.  [[EMBASSY ||18]] WILL FOLLOW UP WITH [[FONMIN|| 4]]  IN EFFORT TO ASSURE THAT INSTRUCTIONS TO [[[[GOCR|| 5]]  DELEGATION || 14]] ARE STRUCTURED SO AS TO INCLUDE POSITIVE RESPONSE TO [[USG ||20]] PROPOSALS ON [[COMMON FUND ||3]] .
