[[AMERICAN||2]] OIL COMPANIES



1. AT THE REQUEST OF [[ MOBIL || 3 ]] AND [[ESSO || 4 ]] LOCAL OFFICES- [[ CALTEX || 12]] DID NOT HAVE [[NEW YORK||2]] PERMISSION TO ASSOCIATE SELF - [[CHARGE || 16]] AND [[ECON COUNSELOR || 17]] CALLED ON [[[[ MOFA || 8]] DEPUTY UNDERSECRETARY MWANGI || 5 ]] 


TO EXPLAIN THAT SHUT DOWN OF [[POL || 9 ]] AND OTHER [[AMERICAN||2]] PRODUCTS TO [[UGANDA || 6]] WAS IN RESPONSE TO [[U.S. || 1]] BOYCOTT LAW. A COPY OF THE TEXT OF THE BOYCOTT LEGISLATION WAS ALSO GIVEN TO [[MWANGI || 5]].


2. [[MWANGI || 5]] EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING OF THIS ACTION ON THE PART OF [[AMERICAN||1]] CONTROLLED AND TOTALLY OWNED COMPANIES. HOWEVER, [[HE || 5 ]] REQUESTED URGENT CLARIFICATION ON THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS ACT TO [[AMERICAN|| 2]] FIRMS WHICH HAD [[GOK || 10]] OR PRIVATE [[KENYAN || 11 ]] PARTICIPATION. [[MWANGI || 5]]  STATED THAT [[HIS || 5]] SUPERIORS WOULD CERTAINLY RAISE THIS QUESTION WITH [[HIM || 5]]. [[MWANGI || 5]]  ALSO SAID THAT [[KENYA || 10 ]] COULD NOT CHOOSE [[ITS || 10]] NEIGHBORS AND THEREFORE, WOULD HAVE TO STAY ON AS GOOD TERMS AS POSSIBLE WITH [[UGANDA || 7 ]]. THE IMPLICATION OF [[HIS || 5]] REMARKS WAS THAT [[GOK || 10]]  MIGHT WELL TAKE EXCEPTION TO BOYCOTT ACTIONS BY [[AMERICAN||2]] FIRMS WHICH HAD [[KENYA || 11]]  PARTNERS.


3. COMMENT: [[MWANGI || 5]]  APPEARED RELAXED ABOUT THE ACTION OF THE OIL COMPANIES AND WAS QUICK TO SEE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN [[AMERICAN||2]] CONTROLLED AND WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDARIES AND OTHERS IN [[KENYA || 11]] . [[MWANGI || 5]]  IS NOT A TRAINED LAWYER AND FURTHER CONSIDERATION IN THE [[GOK || 10]]  MIGHT LEAD TO QUESTIONS AS TO THE APPLICABILITY OF THIS ACTION TO ANY [[KENYA || 11]] REGISTERED COMPANY.


4. IN VIEW OF THE OFFICIAL REQUEST PUT TO [[US|| 13]] BY [[MWANGI || 5]] , REQUEST [[DEPARTMENT’S || 14]] VIEWS AS TO APPLICABILITY OF LAW TO FIRMS WHICH HAVE [[KENYAN GOVERNMENT|| 10]] PARTICIPATION (IN SEVERAL CASES, MAJORITY). IF LAW HELD TO APPLY, WE MUST EXPECT STRONG [[GOK || 10 ]] OBJECTIONS AND, VERY PROBABLY, COUNTER-ACTION OF SOME SORT.
