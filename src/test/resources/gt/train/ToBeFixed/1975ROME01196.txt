1. [[AMBASSADOR||1]] CALLED THIS MORNING (JAN 27) ON [[SECRETARY GENERAL GAJA||2]], [[[[ITALIAN||4]] FOREIGN MINISTRY||3]], TO REVIEW SUBJECT [[PRG||5]] ISSUE, URGE [[ITALIAN||4]] SUPPORT, AND CONVEY MESSAGE REF (A) THAT [[GOI||4]] CAN SAFELY EXPECT GOOD [[EC||6]] COMPANY IN SUPPORT OF [[USG||7]] POSITION, THAT [[USG||7]] CONSIDERS [[ITALIAN||4]] SUPPORT EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, AND THAT [[USG||7]] WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY UNDERSTANDING A SECOND [[ITALIAN||4]] ABSTENTION ON [[PRG||5]] ISSUE AT SECOND SESSION OF CONFERENCE ON LAW OF WAR.

2. [[SECRETARY GENERAL GAJA||2]] ASSURED [[AMBASSADOR||1]] OF [[ITALIAN||4]] SUPPORT ON PROCEDURAL ISSUE, STATING THAT [[ITALIANS||4]] "WILL DO OUR BEST/ TO INSURE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE WILL REQUIRE TWO/THIRDS VOTE. [[GAJA||2]] SAID THAT [[THE GOI||4]] FULLY UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT, TO AVOID HAVING [[THE PRG||5]] PARTICIPATE IN [[GENEVA||8]] AT THE LAW OF WAR CONFERENCE. ON SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE, HOWEVER, WHILE UNDERSTANDING OUR POSITION [[GAJA||2]] SAID THAT THE MATTER WOULD HAVE TO BE DECIDED BY [[MINISTER RUMOR||9]].

3. [[GAJA||2]] EXPLAINED THE BACKGROUND OF THE PREVIOUS [[ITALIAN||4]] ABSTENTION (REFTEL B, PARA 2) AND POINTED OUT THAT [[THE [[ITALIAN||4]] FOREIGN MINISTRY||3]] IS UNDER CONTINUING PRESSURE FROM [[THE [[[[ITALIAN||4]] PARLIAMENTARY||10]] LEFT-WING OPPOSITION||11]], TO UP-GRADE [[ITALIAN||4]] TREATMENT OF [[THE PRG||5]]. [[THE GOI||4]] UNDERSTANDS FULLY THE REASONS WHY [[THE PRG||5]] CANNOT BE GIVEN TREATMENT AS A GOVERNMENT, AS IT HAS NONE OF THE ATTRIBUTES THEREOF. HOWEVER, THE [[PARLIAMENTARY||10]] SITUATION IN [[ITALY||12]] AND THE DEPENDENCE OF [[THE FOURTH [[MORO||13]] GOVERNMENT||4]] ON [[SOCIALISTS (PSI)||14]] VOTES TO MAINTAIN [[ITS||4]] MAJORITY MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ANY DECISION WITH REGARD TO [[THE PRG||5]].

4. WITH REGARD TO THE POSTAL BALLOT CONCERNING POSSIBLE INVITATION TO [[THE PRG||5]] TO ATTEND THE SEVENTH CONGRESS OF [[THE WMO||15]], [[GAJA||2]] SAID THAT [[THE ITALIANS||4]] WILL OPPOSE ANY SUCH INVITATION.

5. COMMENT: [[WE||16]] CAN ASSUME THAT [[[[FOREIGN||3]] MINISTER RUMOR||9]] WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO REVERSE THE DECISION TAKEN LAST YEAR BY [[[[HIS||9]] PREDECESSOR AS FOREIGN MINISTER, AND PRESENT PRIME MINISTER, ALDO MORO||13]]. [[WE||16]] CANNOT BE SANGUINE THAT [[THE ITALIANS||4]] MIGHT OPPOSE [[PRG||5]] PARTICIPATION IN THE LAW OF WAR CONFERENCE IN THE EVENT THAT THE SUBSTANCE COMES TO A VOTE. AT THE SAME TIME [[WE||16]] BELIEVE THAT [[THE ITALIANS||4]] WILL VERY MUCH WISH TO AVOID THE SUBSTANCE OF THE ISSUE AND WILL THEREFORE DO [[THEIR||4]] BEST, AS [[GAJA||2]] PROMISED, TO SEE THAT THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE DOES NOT ARISE.
