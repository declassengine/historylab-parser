1. [[EMBASSY||2]] HAS TELEX DATED 24 DEC FROM [[INKOBROD || 1]] ([[KALODJERA || 8]]) NOTING THAT (A) IN ADDITION TO CHARGES FOR KEEPING PHYKOS, THERE HAVE BEEN EXPENSES FOR CONSTANT MOVING OF SHIP AND VISITS OF INTERESTED PEOPLE REQUESTING VARIOUS ACTIVITIES, (B) SINCE PHYKOS DOCKED FOR LONG TIME [[INKOBROD || 1]] EXPOSED TO UNUSUALLY HIGH EXPENSES, (C) ABSENCE OF REGULAR PAYMENTS BY [[SMITHSONIAN (SMIT) || 3]] DURING LAST 17 MONTHS HAVE COST  [[INKOBROD || 1]] SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT EQUIVALENT TO INTEREST PAYMENTS.


2.  [[INKOBROD || 1]] CONCLUDES THAT MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS INCURRED CAN BE SOLVED BY SALE OF BOAT TO  [[INKOBROD || 1]]. FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY SUGGEST TALKS IN [[BELGRADE || 1]] OR [[KORCULA || 1 ]] IN JANUARY. [[KALODJERA || 8]] BELIEVES  [[INKOBROD || 1]] SHOULD HAVE PRIORITY IN BUYING PHYKOS TO "SOLVE OUR MUTUAL RELATIONS".


3. [[YUGOSLAV || 1]] FIRM FOR INSURANCE OF SHIPS AND AIRCRAFT INFORMS [[EMBASSY||2]] THAT CHARGE FOR 24 HOURS INSURANCE OF 100,000 DOLLARS AGAINST LOSS OF PHYKOS IS 5,000 RPT 5,000 DOLLARS.


4. [[EMBASSY||2]] NOTES IN PARA 2 REFTEL THAT SALE PRICE OF PHYKOS IS MATTER OF CONCERN TO [[SMITHSONIAN || 3]]. AT SAME TIME, DETAILS OF SALE OF VESSEL BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX AND IMPOSITION OF NEW CHARGES BY  [[INKOBROD || 1]] SEEMS LIKELY. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES [[EMBASSY||2]] SUGGESTS THAT [[SMI || 3]] INTERESTS WOULD BE BEST SERVED BY SENDING TO [[YUGOSLAVIA||1]] ABOUT JAN 13 AN [[SMI REPRESENTATIVE  || 3]] EMPOWERED TO MAKE ALL NECESSARY DECISIONS TO SELL SHIP TO  [[INKO-BROD || 1]], [[PFEUFFER || 6]] OR OTHER BUYER.
