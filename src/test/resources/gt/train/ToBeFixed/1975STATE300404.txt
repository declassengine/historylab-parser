[[TEL AVIV||1]] FOR [[ATHERTON||2]]

HOLD FOR OPENING OF BUSINESS


1. IN [[POLADS||3]] CONSIDERATION OF DATES FOR REINFORCED [[MIDDLE EAST||4]] [[NAC||5]], [[YOU||10]] SHOULD NOTE THAT WHILE [[ASSISTANT SECRETARY ATHERTON||2]] HAD TENTATIVELY PLANNED TO ATTEND REINFORCED SESSION IN JANUARY, [[HIS||2]] SCHEDULE REGRETFULLY DOES NOT PERMIT [[HIM||2]] TO BE IN [[BRUSSELS||6]] ON JANUARY 23, AS PROPOSED BY [[CANADIANS||7]]. ALTERNATIVELY, [[WE||13]] WOULD SUGGEST THAT [[ALLIES||9]] EXPLORE POSSIBILITY OF REINFORCED [[COUNCIL||5]] MEETING SOMEWHAT LATER, PERHAPS IN EARLY FEBRUARY. [[YOU||10]] MAY ALSO INDICATE THAT [[WE||13]] WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO SUGGEST ALTERNATIVE DATE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

2. AS TO REINFORCED [[NAC||5]] ON LOS, [[YOU||10]] MAY INDICATE [[US||8]] WILLINGNESS IN PRINCIPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN REINFORCED SESSION IN LATTER HALF OF FEBRUARY TO COINCIDE WITH [[EC||11]]-9 LOS CONSULTATION, AS SUGGESTED BY [[UK||12]]. [[WE||13]] WOULD, OF COURSE, RESERVE FINAL AGREEMENT UNTIL [[WE||13]] KNOW SPECIFIC PROPOSED DATE. [[DEPARTMENT||13]] CONCURS IN [[YOUR||10]] SUGGESTION THAT PROPOSAL FOR "BACK-TO-BACK" [[EC||11]]/[[NAC||5]] LOS SESSIONS BE FORMALLY PROPOSED.

3. REFTEL BEING REPEATED TO [[TEL AVIV||1]] FOR [[ATHERTON||2]].
