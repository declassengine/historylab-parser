(E) [[LONDON||1]] 2003


1. [[[[FAO||3]] CONSULTANT||2]]: WITHOUT REFERRING TO [[FRENCH||4]] DEMARCHE, [[WE||18]] DISCUSSED [[U.S.||5]] VIEWS ON ATTENDANCE BY [[[[FAO||3]] CONSULTANT POPPER||2]] WITH [[JOHN HEAP, [[FCO||7]],||6]] MARCH 4. [[HEAP||6]] SAID THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY THAT [[POPPER||2]] WILL BE AD- MITTED TO MEETING AS OBSERVER. [[HEAP||6]] SUGGESTED HOWEVER THAT [[HE||2]] BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH ANY [[GROUP OF DELEGATES||8]] THAT WISH TO HEAR FROM [[HIM||2]]. THIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE IN A FORMALLY CHAIRED MEETING. [[HEAP||6]], WHO WILL NOT BE IN THE CHAIR, WILL PROBABLY PROPOSE THAT [[HE||6]] FORMALLY INTRODUCE [[POPPER||2]] TO THE [[GROUP||8]] AND THEN HOST INFORMAL SESSION WITH [[HIM||2]]. THIS CAN BE FOLLOWED UP BY PRIVATE DISCUSSION OF [[POPPER'S||2]] VIEWS IN LATER SESSION OF PREPARATORY MEETING. SHOULD [[GROUP||8]] WISH TO MAKE [[ITS||8]] VIEWS KNOWN TO [[POPPER||2]] FOLLOWING THIS PRIVATE SESSION, ANOTHER INFORMAL MEETING COULD BE CONVENED.

2. [[[[ANTARCTIC||10]] MARINE LIVING RESOURCES||9]]: DRAWING UPON REFTEL B, [[WE||18]] REITERATED TO [[HEAP||6]] [[USG||5]] APPRECIATION OF [[HIS||6]] EFFORTS ON DRAFT [[UK||11]] PAPER AND OUTLINED [[DEPARTMENT'S||12]] THOUGHTS ABOUT POSSIBLE [[US||5]] INITIATIVE. [[HEAP||6]] DESCRIBED [[OUR||18]] COMMENTS AS VERY HELPFUL AND ASKED [[US||18]] TO THANK [[THE DEPARTMENT||12]] "VERY MUCH" FOR [[ITS||12]] PROMPT RESPONSE TO [[HIS||6]] SUGGESTION. [[HE||6]] SAID [[HE||6]] HAD BEEN WAITING FOR [[US||5]] REACTION BEFORE DECIDING WHAT [[UK||11]] POSITION SHOULD BE. [[HE||6]] EXPRES- SED CONCERN THAT [[UK||11]] PAPER MIGHT CONCEIVABLY PREJUDICE DEVELOPMENT OF MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT REGIME. THERE MAY BE, FOR EXAMPLE, STUMBLING BLOCKS INHERENT IN LINKAGE BETWEEN SIMPLE EXCHANGE OF CATCH STATISTICS AND [[COMMISSION||9]] DECISIONS TO IMPLEMENT ENFORCEMENT MEASURES WHICH WOULD REDUCE SCOPE FOR EFFECTIVE ACTION. [[HE||6]] IS CONSIDERING WHETHER [[HE||6]] CAN REDRAFT PAPER IN A FORM THAT WILL NOT FRIGHTEN OFF LESS COMMITTED [[TREATY MEMBERS||13]] WHILE AT SAME TIME MAKING IT MORE RESPONSIVE TO [[HIS||6]] PERCEPTION OF [[U.S.||5]] NEEDS.

3. AT THE SAME TIME, [[HEAP||6]] CONSIDERS THAT IT WOULD BE A "USEFUL FIRST MEASURE" FOR [[U.S.||5]] TO CIRCULATE AN OUT- LINE OF QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE ANSWERED IN DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION MEASURES FOR [[THE SOUTHERN OCEAN||14]]. [[HE||6]] "URGED" THAT [[[[U.S.||5]] DELEGATION||15]] BE PREPARED TO TABLE THESE QUESTIONS. [[HE||6]] ALSO SUGGESTED THAT [[[[U.S.||5]] AND [[UK||11]] DELS||16]] GET TOGETHER EITHER PRIOR TO OR DURING EARLY STAGES OF MEETING TO CONSIDER WHETHER [[UK||11]] DRAFT AS ALREADY CIRCULATED WOULD BE USEFUL OR WHETHER SOME NEW DRAFT SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. [[HEAP||6]] WOULD BE PRE- PARED TO COME TO [[LONDON||1]] ON SUNDAY MARCH 13 TO TAKE PART IN SUCH DISCUSSIONS.

4. [[GROUP OF EXPERTS||47]] MEETING: [[HEAP||6]] HAS HEARD NOTHING YET FROM [[SCAR||48]] IN RESPONSE TO [[HIS||6]] LETTER OF FEBRUARY 1 TO [[ITS||48]] [[EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GEORGE HEMMAN||49]] (AS CONTAINED REFTEL E). [[HE||6]] HAS, HOWEVER, RECEIVED LETTER FROM [[[[SCAR||48]] PRESIDENT GJELSVIK||50]] WHO "SUGGESTED STRONGLY" THAT [[GROUP OF EXPERTS||47]] NEED TO AVOID DUPLICATING WORK OF [[SCAR||48]]. [[GJELSVIK||50]] SAID [[GROUP||47]] SHOULD CONCENTRATE ON ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF [[ANTARCTIC||10]] MINERAL DEVELOPMENT. [[HEAP||6]] SAID THAT IMPRESSION THAT [[US||5]] DOES NOT LIKE IDEA OF DISCUSSING ECONOMIC SIDE OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE OF ITS PROBLEMATIC NATURE. [[HEAP||6]] HAS DRAFTED DETAILED OUTLINE OF TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR [[GROUP OF EXPERTS||47]] BASED ON [[GJELSVIK'S||50]] COMMENTS. [[HE||6]] IS HOWEVER VERY UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE ECON- OMIC SIDE OF THE PAPER AND IS "VERY KEEN" TO DISCUSS IT WITH [[[[US||5]] DEL||15]] BEFORE TABLING IT AT MARCH MEETING. [[HE||6]] IS SENDING COPIES TO [[GJELSVIK||50]] AND [[EMBASSY||18]]. [[WE||18]] WILL CABLE PERTINENT PORTIONS ON RECEIPT.

5. AS ABOVE WAS BEING TYPED, [[WE||18]] WERE GIVEN [[STATE||12]] A-840 WHICH WAS NOT RECEIVED BY [[EMBASSY||18]] UNTIL LATE MARCH 3. [[WE||18]] ARE HAVING COPY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STUDY HAND DELIVERED TO [[HEAP||6]] THIS AFTERNOON.
