1. FIGHTING ALONG TRADITIONAL CONFRONTATION LINE BETWEEN [[AYN AR-RUMANNAH||1]] AND [[SHIYAH||2]], WHICH HAD BROKEN OUT APRIL 9 AND DIED DOWN MORNING APRIL 10, RESUMED AFTERNOON APRIL 10 AND IS CONTINUING AT THIS TIME. [[EMBOFFS||3]] AND [[[[MARINE||4]] SECURITY GUARDS||5]] HAVE OBSERVED CONSIDERABLE RIFLE AND AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE AS WELL AS INTERMITTENT ARTILLERY AND TANK FIRE THROUGHOUT DAY.

2. ON APRIL 10 [[ADF||6]] HAD ISSUED ORDERS TO "SHOOT ON SIGHT" [[ANY ARMED MEN||7]] SEEN IN AREA. AFTERNOON OF APRIL 11 [[SYRIANS||8]] MOVED [[ARMORED TANK BATTALION||9]] INTO AREA AND BEGAN ENGAGING BOTH [[CHRISTIANS||10]] AND [[[[LEBANESE||11]] LEFTISTS||12]]. ([[WE||13]] HAVE NO EVIDENCE SO FAR OF [[PALESTINIAN||14]] PARTICIPATION. [[[[EMBASSY||13]] LOCAL EMPLOYEE||15]] HELD UP BY [[GUNMEN||7]] IN AREA ON APRIL 10 NOW SAYS [[THEY||7]] WERE LEBANESE [[SHIA||16]], NOT [[PALESTINIANS||14]]. SEE [[BEIRUT||11]] 2011).

3. [[EMBOFFS||3]] OBSERVED [[ARMED MILITIA||17]] THROUGHOUT [[CHRISTIAN||10]] SUBURB OF [[FURN ASH SHUBBAK||18]] AS WELL AS [[TWO ARMED [[[[LEBANESE||11]] LEFTIST||12]] MILITIA||19]] IN [[CORNICHE MAZRA||20]] AREA. ELSEWHERE, HOWEVER, LIFE IN [[CITY||11]] APPEARED NORMAL. TRAFFIC IN [[ASHRAFIYAH||21]] AND ACROSS [[CITY||11]] ON [[CHEHAB EXPRESSWAY||22]], FOR EXAMPLE, IS NORMAL.

4. [[[[NLP||23]] SOURCES||24]] CLAIM THAT [[DANY CHAMOUN||25]] APRIL 10 MADE AGREEMENT WITH [[LOCAL [[SYRIAN||8]] COMMANDERS||26]] TO FACILITATE [[THEIR||26]] ENTRY INTO [[AREA||11]] AND THAT [[[[HIS||25]] PARTY||23]] IS COOPERATING WITH [[SYRIANS||27]], WHO ARE BEING FIRED ON BY [[KATAEB||28]]. [[RELIABLE [[LEBANESE||11]] JOURNALIST||29]], HOWEVER, TELLS [[US||13]] [[SYRIANS||27]] ARE EXCHANGING FIRE WITH [[NLP||23]] AS WELL AS [[LEFTISTS||12]].

5. CAUSE OF ORIGINAL APRIL 9 INCIDENT REMAINS OBSCURE. NUMEROUS THEORIES HAVE BEEN ADVANCED, FROM PERSONAL QUARREL, TO KIDNAPPING, TO [[SYRIAN||8]] PLOT DESIGNED TO GIVE [[ADF||6]] PRETEXT FOR WIPING OUT [[MILITIA||17]]. FIGHTING APRIL 9 AND 10 RESULTED IN AT LEAST [[SEVEN PEOPLE KILLED||30]], INCLUDING [[ONE [[SUDANESE||31]] [[ADF||6]] SOLDIER||32]], AND [[27 PEOPLE WOUNDED||30]], ACCORDING TO INDEPENDENT [[AN NAHAR||33]] APRIL 11.)

6. [[[[PALESTINIAN||14]] LEADERSHIP||34]] DOES NOT APPEAR ANXIOUS TO EXPLOIT SITUATION. ARTICLE IN [[[[PLO||35]] PAPER FALASTIN AL- THAWRA||36]] ON APRIL 10 "WARNED [[ALL [[LEBANESE||37]] FORCES||38]] AGAINST FALLING INTO THE TRAP OF INTERNECINE FIGHTING" (SEPTEL).

7. [[PIERRE GEMAYEL||39]] TOLD PRESS APRIL 10 THAT "90 PERCENT OF [[[[LEBANESE||11]] CHRISTIANS||10]] AND [[MOSLEMS||40]] AND 90 PERCENT OF [[PALESTINIANS||41]] WHO ARE LOYAL TO [[THEIR||14]] CAUSE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE." [[BACHIR GEMAYEL||42]] BLAMED THE FIGHTING ON A “[[PALESTINIAN||41]]-[[LEFTIST||12]]-[[REJECTIONIST||43]]” ATTEMPT TO CAUSE TROUBLE.
