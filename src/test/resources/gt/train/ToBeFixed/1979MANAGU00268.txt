1. ON JANUARY 12, AN ORGANIZATIONAL MEETING WAS HELD BY [[THE GROUPS || 1 ]] WHO WILL INITIALLY COMPRISE [[THE PROJECTED NEW OPPOSITION SUPER-COALITION, THE NATIONAL PATRIOTIC FRONT (FPN)|| 1]]. THE GOALS OF [[THE PROPOSED GROUP || 1]] ARE: DEFENSE OF [[MATIONAL || 4]] SOVEREIGNTY, OVERTHROW OF [[THE DICTATORSHIP || 19]] (READ [[THE GON || 4]]), AND STRUGGLE FOR EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY, JUSTICE AND SOCIAL PROGRESS.


2. GROUPS PRESENT AT THE MEETING WERE: [[UNITED PEOPLE'S MOVEMENT (MPU) || 2]], [[THE GROUP OF TWELVE || 3]], [[THE INDEPEDENT LIBERAL PARTY (PLI) || 6]], [[THE RADIO JOURNALISTS' UNION OF [[MANAGUA || 4]] || 7]] , [[THE [[NICARAGUAN || 4]] WORKERS' CENTRAL || 8]], AT LEAST ONE FACTION OF [[THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY || 20 ]], [[THE POPULAR SOCIAL CHRISTIAN PARTY || 9]], AND [[THE [[NICARAGUAN || 4]] DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT (MDN) || 10]]. THE LATTER THREE


DECLARED THEMSELVES


TO BE OBSERVERS BUT NOT PARTICIPANTS.


3. AMONG THE POINTS MADE BY SPEAKERS AT THE MEETING WAS THAT IMPERIALISM IN [[CENTRAL AMERICA|| 11]]— ESPECIALLY IN [[NICARAGUA || 12 ]]—CAN ONLY BE OPPOSED SUCCESSFULLY BY THE UNITY OF [[[[ NATIONAL || 4 ]] FORCES || 13]]. ONE SPAKER DEFINED [[THE FPN || 5]] AS, “THE DEFENSE OF [[NATIONAL || 4]] SOVEREIGNTY, AS THE RIGHT OF SELF-DETERMINATION BY [[THE [[NICARAGUAN || 4]] PEOPLE, THE OVERTHROW OF [[THE DICTATORSHIP || 19]] AND THE ERADICATION OF ALL [[ITS || 19]]  VESTIGES, AND THE LAUNCHING OF SUBSTANTIAL MEASUERS ON ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LEVELS TENDING TO CONSOLIDATE THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRATIC TRANSFORMAITON IN [[NICARAGUA || 12]].”
4. COMMENT: [[THE FPN || 5]] IS EXPECTED TO BE FORMALLY LAUNCHED IN THE NEAR FUTURE-- POSSIBLY THIS WEEK. WHEN CONSTITUTED, [[EMB || 15]] EXPECTS [[IT || 5]] TO BE HEAVLY INFLUENCED BY LEFTIST, RADICAL GROUPS AND TO ADOPT A CONFRONTATIONAL STRATEGY. THUS FAR, [[THE FAO || 17]] APPEARS TO BE RESISTING THE MOUNTING PRESSURE (INCLUDING THAT OF [[ ALFONSO ROBELO || 16]]) TO JOIN THE [[THE FPN || 5]].
