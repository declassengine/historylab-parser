1. [[THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF BENIN (GPRB)||1]] HAS A PRODIGAL LITTLE BROTHER RELATIONSHIP WITH ITS NEIGHBOR [[NIGERIA||2]]. [[IT||1]] HAS NEVER OPENLY CHALLANGED OR OPPOSED [[THE FEDERAL MILITARY GOVERNMENT||2]], INDEED [[GPRB||1]] PRAISE OF [[THE FMG||2]] IS EFFUSIVE AT TIMES, BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT IDEOLOGICAL DIFFER- ENCES AND [[BENINESE||1]] WORRIES ABOUT [[ITS||1]] NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY CLOUD THE RELATIONSHIP. [[NIGERIA||2]] TENDS TO FOLLOW A POLICY OF "BENIGN NEGLECT" IN DEALING WITH [[BENIN||1]], AND IN GENERAL CONCENTRATES [[ITS||2]] DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS ON MATTERS OF SPECIFIC INTEREST: TRANSIT TRADE TO [[NIGERIA||3]] THROUGH [[BENIN||4]] AND FROM [[THE COTONOU PORT||5]], SUGAR AND CEMENT PROJECTS IN [[BENIN||4]] FOR FUTURE EXPORT TO [[NIGERIA||3]], POLICE COOPERATION FOR PURSUIT OF [[NIGERIAN||3]] CRIMINALS FLEEING INTO [[BENIN||4]]. [[SENIOR RESIDENT [[NIGERIAN||2]] DIPLOMATS||6]] USUALLY ADOPT A "PROCONSUL" ATTITUDE TOWARD [[BENIN||1]], VIEWING [[IT||1]] AS FRANCOPHONE PROVICE OF [[NIGERIA||2]], AND TEND TO DISREGARD [[BENINESE||1]] POLICIES AND POLITICS AS OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE. BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY OF [[COTONOU||5]] TO THE BORDER, [[[[NIGERIAN||2]] AMBASSADORS||6]] OFTEN SEEM TO BE ACTUALLY RESIDENT IN [[LAGOS||7]].

2. TRIBALISM PLAYS AN UNDERLYING ROLE IN [[BENINESE||1]]-[[NIGERIAN||2]] DIFFERENCES. ALTHOUGH [[PRESIDENT KEREKOU||8]] IS A [[SOMBA||25]], ONE OF THE MANY [[VOLTAIQUE TRIBES||9]] OF NORTHWESTERN [[BENIN||4]], THE DOMINANT GROUP IN [[[[BENINESE||1]] CIVIL SERVICE AND OFFICER CORPS||10]] REMAINS [[THE FON||11]]. [[FON||11]]-[[YORUBA||12]] TRIBAL HATRED STRETCHES BACK TO THE WARS OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY. DURING [[BENIN'S||1]] MANY POLITICAL CRISES OF THE 1960'S, THE POSSIBILITY OF [[NIGERIAN||2]] ANNEXATION OF [[BENIN'S||1]] PREDOMINANTLY [[YORUBA||12]] [[OUEME PROVINCE||13]] WAS ENCOURAGED BY [[REGIONAL LEADERS||14]]. SIMILAR TRIBAL PROBLEMS EXIST BETWEEN [[THE FON||11]] AND [[BARIBA||15]] OF THE NORTHEAST, WHOSE AREA EXTENDS INTO [[NIGERIA||3]].

3. THE [[GPRB||1]] VIEW OF [[THE PRESENT NIGERIAN GOVERNMENT||2]] IS EXTERNALLY FAVORABLE, BUT IN ACTUALITY THERE IS LITTLE CONTACT. DURING THE HOURS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ASSASSINATION OF [[PRESIDENT MURTALA||16]], MARXIST-LENINIST [[[[BENIN'S||4]] VOICE||17]] WAS BROAD- CASTING MESSAGES OF SOLIDARITY WITH THE "REVOLUTIONARY" [[YOUNG COUP PLOTTERS||18]]. ONLY AFTER IT BECAME APPARENT THAT THE COUP HAD FAILED DID THE REQUIRED EXPRESSIONS OF GRIEF BEGIN TO FLOW FROM [[THE "VOICE OF THE REVOLUTION”||17]]. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIVE PROBLEMS BETWEEN [[THE TWO GOVERNMENTS||19]] BEYOND BORDER CLOSING ENGENDERED BY [[BENIN'S||1]] SOMEWHAT PRECARIOUS INTERNAL SECURITY SITUATION AND DESIRES TO CAUSE DISCOMFORT FOR [[TOGO||20]], [[THE GPRB||1]] WOULD BE MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH A MORE LEFTIST REGIME IN [[LAGOS||2]], FOR PURELY IDEOLOGICAL REASONS.

4. [[GPRB||1]] IS RESPECTFUL OF [[NIGERIA'S||2]] ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND DOMINENT POLITICAL POSITION IN [[BLACK AFRICA||21]]. WHEN COMMON VIEWS ARE HELD, [[GPRB||1]] IS STRONG IN PRAISE FOR [[NIGERIA||2]]. WHEN [[FMG||2]] ESPOUSES MORE MODERATE STANDS OR MAKES FRIENDLY GESTURES TOWARD [[WEST||22]], NO MENTION OF THIS IS MADE IN [[GPRB||1]] MEDIA OR OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS.

5. POST CONSLUDES THAT [[GPRB||1]] WILL NOT VOLUNTARILY ACCEPT [[NIGERIA||2]] AS SPOKESMAN FOR [[AFRICA||21]] IN ANY CONCILIATORY MOVE TOWARD [[WEST||22]] OR [[US||23]] BUT DIRECT INFLUENCE BY [[NIGERIA||2]] COULD STIFLE POTENTIAL [[GPRB||1]] DISSENT.
