1. IN FURTHER DISCUSSION OF MATTER RAISED REF. (A), [[PERMREP  || ]] SHOULD INFORM [[AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ  || 1]] THAT [[WE || 2]] CONTINUE TO BE VERY CONCERNED OVER TREND TO POLITICIZE [[UNESCO || 3]] ACTIVITIES, [[WE  || 2]] INTEND IN [[OUR  || 2]] PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AND DIPLOMATIC CONTACTS TO CONTINUE TO SPEAK AGAINST THIS TENDENCY, TO CALL ATTENTION TO DOUBLE STANDARDS, AND TO ENCOURAGE STRICT ADHERENCE TO [[UNESCO'S || 3]] TECHNICAL MISSION AS DESCRIBED IN [[ITS || 3]] CONSTITUTION. [[WE  || 2]] WILL, OF COURSE, ALWAYS STAND FOR FAIR PLAY, EVENHANDEDNESS, AND FOR AFFORDING FULL OPPORTUNITY TO [[CHILE || 4]] OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND [[ITS  || 4]] POSITION. IN THIS CONNECTION [[WE  || 2]] ARE PREPARED TO SUPPORT INCLUSION IN THE AGENDA OF THE 97TH [[UNESCO EXECUTIVE BOARD  || 6]] OF ITEM PROPOSED BY [[CHILE  || 4]] CONCERNING [[ITS || 4]] PROTEST OVER PROCEDURES FOLLOWED IN REACHING PREVIOUS DECISIONS RELATING TO [[CHILE || 4]]. [[PERMREP  || ]] SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT POSITIONS TAKEN BY OTHER [[LATIN AMERICAN STATES  || 5]] REPRESENTED ON [[THE EXECUTIVE BOARD  || 6]] WILL BE IMPORTANT WITH RESPECT TO PROPOSALS WHICH UNFRIENDLY GOVERNMENTS MAY BE PLANNING TO MAKE.


2. [[DEPT || 2]] NOTES FROM PROVISIONAL AGENDA THAT PROPOSALS CONCERNING [[CHILE || 7]] COULD BE PUT FORWARD EITHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE REPORT OF [[THE COMMITTEE ON CONVENTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN EDUCATION || 12]] OR IN CONNECTION WITH ITEM ON STATE OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE, CULTURE AND INFORMATION IN  [[CHILE || 7]], WHICH IS TO FEATURE A REPORT BY [[THE DIRECTOR GENERAL|| ]]. WHILE WE MUST RESERVE [[OUR || 2]] FINAL POSITION UNTIL [[WE|| 2]] KNOW THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSALS WHICH MAY BE MADE, PERMREP SHOULD INDICATE TO [[AMBASSADOR FERNANDEZ || 1]] [[OUR|| 2]] THINKING THAT IT MAY BE TACTICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO RELATE ANY PROPOSALS FOR ACTION BY [[UNESCO|| 3]] TO [[THE AD HOC WORKING GROUP || 10]] WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY [[THE UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION || 8]] AT [[ITS|| 8]] 1975 SESSION EARLIER THIS YEAR. [[THIS GROUP|| 8]], WHICH HAS THE MANDATE TO INQUIRE INTO THE PRESENT SITUATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN [[CHILE || 7]]  ON THE BASIS OF PREVIOUS [[UN|| 9]] RESOLUTIONS, OF A VISIT TO [[CHILE||7]], AND "OF ORAL AND WRITTEN EVIDENCE TO BE GATHERED FROM ALL RELEVANT SOURCES," HAS BEEN PROMISED THE COOPERATION OF [[THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT ||4]]. IF IT DEVELOPS THAT ALLEGATIONS ARE MADE AGAINST [[CHILE || 4]]  IN [[THE EXECUTIVE BOARD || 6]] WHICH MAY BE DEEMED TO FALL WITHIN THE MANDATE OF [[THE AD HOC WORKING GROUP || 10]] , [[UNESCO EXECUTIVE BOARD  || 6]] COULD REFER ALLEGATIONS TO [[THE UN AD HOC WORKING GROUP || 10]] FOR INQUIRY AS A PART OF [[ITS || 9]] GENERAL MANDATE. FURTHER [[EXECUTIVE BOARD  ||6 ]] ACTION WOULD AWAIT COMPLETION OF REPORT BY [[UN WORKING GROUP || 10]] .


3. RE [[ OUR ||2]] POSITION ON [[COMMITTEE DEALING WITH COMMUNICA- TIONS || 13]] RAISED REF.(B), AGREE THAT SINCE [[US || 11]] NO LONGER MEMBER OF [[COMMITTEE || 13]] PERMDEL WOULD HAVE NO BASIS FOR INVOLVEMENT THIS ISSUE PRIOR TO PRESENTATION OF PROPOSALS FOR ACTION BY [[EXECUTIVE BOARD || 6]]. AS CONCERNS [[OUR||11]] STAND WHEN MATTER REACHES [[EXECUTIVE BOARD ITSELF||6]], [[OUR ||11]] POSITION WILL DEPEND UPON NATURE OF ANY SPECIFIC PROPOSALS WHICH MAY BE PUT FORWARD ON BASIS OF [[COMMITTEE'S || 13]] CONCLUSIONS. HOWEVER, IF TACTIC DESCRIBED IN PARA 2 ABOVE APPEALS TO [[CHILEANS||4 ]] [[THEY||4]] MIGHT WISH TO GET FRIENDLY MEMBERS OF [[COMMITTEE || 13]] TO WORK IN DIRECTION OF REFERRAL OF COMPLAINTS TO [[HRC WORKING GROUP || 10]] .


4. FYI. [[DEPT||2]] DOES NOT DESIRE THAT [[WE ||11]] ASSUME POSTURE IN PRIVATE CONVERSATIONS AS DEFENDER OF [[CHILEAN GOVERNMENT||4]]. [[OUR||11]] OPINIONS ON DEPOLITICIZATION, EVENHANDEDNESS AND FAIR PLAY MUST BE EXPRESSED IN GENERAL TERMS AS APPLYING ACROSS THE BOARD, REGARDLESS OF THE IDENTITY OF THE GOVERNMENT WHICH MAY BE INVOLVED. THESE CONSIDERATIONS MAY ON SOME FUTURE OCCASION APPLY TO THOSE WHO NOW WOULD IGNORE THEM IN THE [[CHILEAN ||4]]  CASE.


END FYI.


[[KISSINGER || 14]]
