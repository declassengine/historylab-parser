1. ON DEC 23, [[[[ITALY'S || 1]] CABINET || 2]] APPROVED THE LONG-AWAITED NOM- INATION OF [[[[CISL || 21]] SECGEN BRUNO STORTI || 4]] AS [[PRESIDENT OF [[THE TRI- PARTITE NATIONAL ECONOMIC AND LABOR COUNCIL (CNEL) || 5]] || 4]] . [[STORTI'S || 4]] APPOINTMENT BECOMES EFFECTIVE WHEN SIGNED BY [[PRESIDENT LEONE || 6]] AND PUBLISHED IN [[THE GAZETTE || 7]]. [[STORTI || 4]] WILL HOLD A PRESS CON- FERENCE JAN 5, PRESUMABLY TO MAKE [[HIS|| 4]] PREVIOUSLY-ANNOUNCED RETIREMENT EFFECTIVE.


2. [[[[CISL || 21]] DEPUTY SECGEN LUIGI MACARIO || 8]] IS EXPECTED TO ACT AS SECGEN UNTIL [[CISL'S || 21]] CONGRESS IN MAY OR JUNE 1977. PRESS AND PRIVATE SPECULATION IS THAT NO NEW INTERIM DEPUTY SECGEN WILL BE NAMED. THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MILITANTS SUPPORT- ING [[PIERRE CARNITI || 9]] AND MODERATES SUPPORTING [[FRANCO MARINI  || 10]] WILL THUS PROBABLY BE POSTPONED UNTIL THE CONGRESS. [[THE CISL GEN- ERAL COUNCIL || 21]] MEETING JAN 13-15 IS EXPECTED TO SET CONGRESS DATES AND CONFIRM INTERIM ARRANGEMENTS.


3. [[LEADERS OF [[ITALY'S || 12]] FEDERATION OF LABOR CONFEDERATIONS (CCU) || 11]] MET WITH ECONOMIC EXPERTS OF MOST PARTIES LAST WEEK TO DISCUSS WHAT TO DO ABOUT [[ITALY'S|| 12]] ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRISIS. ALMOST ALL PARTIES URGED FURTHER UNION CONCESSIONS ON THE COST-OF-LIVING ESCALATOR. A [[CCU DELEGATION || 11]] ALSO CON- TINUED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT [[GOVERNMENT || 1]] PLANS WITH [[FINANCE MIN- ISTER PANDOLFI || 13]] AND OTHER OFFICIALS. THE [[CCU LEADER'S || 11]] NEXT MEETING WITH [[PM ANDREOTTI || 14]] HAS BEEN POSTPONED FROM DEC 29 TO JAN 5. ON DEC 29, [[THE CCU ||11]] AND [[GOI OFFICIALS ||1]] WILL NOW HOLD TECHNICAL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PUBLIC INDUSTRY INVESTMENT AND OTHER SUBJECTS. [[THE CCU LEADERS || 11]] REPORTEDLY PLAN ANOTHER MEET- ING WITH THE PARTIES' ECONOMIC EXPERTS BEFORE [[THEY ||11]] FACE [[THEIR ||11]] OWN FOLLOWERS AT THE JAN 7-8 [[ASSEMBLY OF DELEGATES OF MEMBER UNIONS OF [[THE THREE CONFEDERATIONS ||19 ]] || 18]] , IN [[ROME||12]]. [[[[UIL || 15]] SECGEN BEN- VENUTO || 16]] WILL ADDRESS [[THE ASSEMBLY || 18]] ON BEHALF OF THE [[CCU SECRE- TARIAT || 11]].


4. [[THE GENERAL COUNCIL OF THE [[ITALIAN ||1]] METALWORKERS' FEDERA- TION (FLM) || 24]], WHICH UNITES THE METALWORKERS FEDERATIONS OF [[THE THREE CONFEDERATIONS ||19 ]] ([[FIOM||25]]/[[CGIL||26]], [[FIM|| 27]]/[[CISL ||21]] AND [[UILM) || 3]], MET DEC 20-21 TO AGREE ON STRATEGY FOR COMPANY-LEVEL NEGOTIATIONS. THE ATMOSPHERE WAS HEATED, WITH CONSIDERABLE SHARP CRITICISM OF THE [[NATIONAL LABOR LEADERSHIP (CCU) ||11]] FOR OFFERING CONCES- SIONS TO [[GOVERNMENT ||1]] AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY ([[CONFINDUSTRIA||20]]). ACCORDING TO ONE PROMINENT PARTICIPANT (A [[CISL || 21]] MILITANT), [[THE COMMUNISTS || 22]] SUCCEEDED ONLY PARTIALLY IN PACIFYING THE WORKERS AND SUPPORTING THE [[[[ANDREOTTI || 14]] GOVERNMENT || 1]] AUSTERITY PROGRAM.


5. MEANWHILE, [[THE CCU LEADERSHIP ||11]] BEGAN MEETINGS WITH UNIONS WITH SPECIAL COST-OF-LIVING ESCALATOR SYSTEMS (E.G., BANK, INSURANCE, MUNICIPAL TRANSIT AND CHEMICAL WORKERS) TO PER- SUADE THEM TO REDUCE THEIR BENEFITS TO THE NORM THROUGHOUT INDUSTRY.


6. SEVERAL AUTONOMOUS UNIONS HAVE CANCELLED HOLIDAY STRIKES AND TACITLY ACCEPTED THE [[CCU|| 11]]-NEGOTIATED PUBLIC EMPLOYEE AGREE- MENT. THE [[AUTONOMOUS RAILWAY UNION (FISAFS) || 23]] , HOWEVER, CONFIRMED ITS FOUR-DAY NATIONAL RAIL STRIKE STARTING DEC 29. THE [[CCU ||11]] RAIL AFFILIATES WHICH CLAIM 70 PERCENT OF RAILWAY EMPLOYEES, WILL WORK TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF THE [[FISAFS  || 23]] STRIKE, BUT IT WILL STILL PROBABLY, DISRUPT A LOT OF HOLIDAY RETURN TRAVEL.
