B. [[STATE || 1]] 290453 AND PREVIOUS



1. INTRODUCTION. AS WITH DRAFT DISCUSSED REF B, MOST CRITICAL OBJECTION TO [[PHILIPPINE || 2]] RESOLUTION IS 0.7 PERCENT TARGET, AND [[DELEGATION || 9]] MAY DRAW ON REF B FOR APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE. AS [[PHILIPPINE || 2]] RESOLUTION IS FOLLOW-UP TO RESO- LUTION 3489 (XXX), WHICH [[WE || 1]] VOTED AGAINST BECAUSE OF FAVOR- ABLE REFERENCES TO NIEO AND CERDS AND ITS ENDORSEMENT OF THE 0.7 PERCENT TARGET, AND BECAUSE IT FOCUSES ON THE TARGET AND ON SPECIFIC MEASURES FOR OBTAINING THE TARGET, [[WE || 1]]  SEE LITTLE HOPE OF ARRIVING AT ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE LANGUAGE. INDEED, THIS DRAFT GOES CONSIDERABLY BEYOND THE OCTOBER TDB RESOLUTION IN SPECIFYING METHODS OF ODA INCREASES WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVELY LIMIT LEGISLATIVE CON- SIDERATION OF AID LEVELS AND HENCE INFRINGE, AT LEAST POTENTIALLY, ON CONSTITUTIONAL REQUISITES. [[OUR || 1]]  PREFERENCE WOULD BE FOR A MORE GENERAL RESOLUTION WHICH REFERS TO [[THE TDB'S || 3]] DISCUSSION OF THIS ISSUE AND ENDORSES ITS CALL IN PARA 1(B) OF THE RESOLUTION IT ADOPTED THAT "...[[DEVELOPED COUNTRIES || 4]] SHOULD CONSIDER ADOPTING NEW AND ADDITIONAL METHODS FOR INCREASING CONCESSIONAL FLOWS..."


2. IF [[PHILIPPINES|| 2]] INSIST ON PRESSING THIS DRAFT, [[YOU ||5]] SHOULD SEEK THE CHANGES INDICATED BELOW. WHILE [[WE || 1]] DO NOT SEEK CONFRONTATION, UNLESS INDICATED CHANGES ARE MADE, [[WE || 1]]-AND THE OTHER GROUP B MEMBERS-WILL HAVE TO MAKE EXTENSIVE RESERVATIONS OR MORE LIKELY, [WE || 1]] WILL VOTE AGAINST THE RESOLUTION AS WAS THE CASE WITH 3489.


3. SPECIFIC COMMENTS. PREAMBLE, PARA 3: SEEK TO LIMIT THIS PARA TO READ "DISTURBED OVER THE ADEQUACY OF THE FLOW OF ODA DURING THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT DECADE". THE .33 PERCENT FIGURE IS MISLEADING AS AN INDICATOR OF "STAGNATION" (ALTHOUGH CORRECT AS AN AVERAGE FIGURE IT OBSCURES INCREASE FROM .33 PERCENT TO .36 PERCENT FROM 1974 TO 1975) AND THE DISCUSSION IMPLIES ACCEPTANCE OF THE 0.7 TARGET.


4. PREAMBLE, PARA 5: SEEK TO LIMIT PARA TO READ "NOTING WITH CONCERN THAT THE NEED FOR LONG-TERM SUSTAINED DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE HAS BECOME MORE URGENT." [[WE || 1]] CANNOT ACCEPT THE IMPLICATION IN THE REMAINDER OF THE PARA THAT THE INCREASED URGENCY IS THE RESULT ONLY OF THE FACTORS LISTED.


5. RE PREAMBLE, PARA 6 AND OPERATIVE PARA 1: ALTHOUGH [[WE || 1]] VOTED AGAINST RESOLUTION 3489 (XXX) (VOTE WAS 112-1(US)-14) [[WE || 1]] HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE REFERENCES IN THESE PARAGRAPHS. HOWEVER, [[OUR||1]] AGREEMENT TO NOTE THE REPORT (A/31/186) PRE- SENTED PURSUANT TO RESOLUTION 3489 IN NO WAY IMPLIES ACCEPTANCE OF THE CONCLUSIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS OF THAT REPORT, MANY OF WHICH OVERSTATE THE CASE FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE TO [[THE LDC'S ||6]].


6. RE OPERATIVE PARA 2: SEE REF B, PARA 9.


7. RE OPERATIVE PARA 3: SEEK TO LIMIT THIS PARA TO READ "URGES GOVERNMENTS OF DONOR COUNTRIES TO ACCELERATE THE TRANSFER OF REAL RESOURCES TO [[DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ||7]] ON A PREDICTABLE, CONTINUOUS AND INCREASINGLY ASSURED BASIS". [[E || 1]] CANNOT ACCEPT REFERENCE TO ANY SPECIFIC METHODS OF ODA INCREMENT. IN [[OUR || 1]] VIEW, THIS IS PROPERLY A MATTER FOR DONOR COUNTRIES TO DECIDE, IN KEEPING WITH THEIR OWN CONSTITU- TIONAL AND BUDGETARY PROCEDURES.


8. RE OPERATIVE PARA 4: [[WE || 1]] CANNOT ACCEPT THIS PARAGRAPH WHICH, AS IN PARA 3, CITES A SPECIFIC METHOD FOR INCREAS- ING ODA.


9. RE OPERATIVE PARA 5: [[WE || 1]] CANNOT ACCEPT THE DRAFT LANGUAGE WHICH IMPLIES THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRO- MOTING INCREASED FLOWS OF PRIVATE CAPITAL LIES ENTIRELY WITH [[DEVELOPED COUNTRIES ||4]]. SEEK TO LIMIT THIS PARA TO READ "RECOMMENDS FURTHER THAT POLICIES BE DEVELOPED TO PROMOTE INCREASED FLOWS OF PRIVATE CAPITAL TO [[DEVELOPING COUNTRIES || 7]], INCLUDING THE EXAMINATION OF GOVERNMENTAL RULES AND RESOLUTIONS ON ACCESS OF [[DEVELOPING COUNTRIES || 7]] TO PRIVATE MONEY AND CAPITAL MARKETS."


10. WHILE [[OUR || 1]] EVALUATION OF THIS DRAFT RESOLUTION IS EXTREMELY NEGATIVE, AS IS [[OUR ||1]] ESTIMATION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATING ACCEPTABLE LANGUAGE, PRIOR TO SUPPLYING GUIDANCE ON FINAL ACTION, [[WE||1]] WILL NEED THE FINAL LANGUAGE AND [[YOUR|| 5 ]] EVALUATION OF WHICH COUNTRIES WOULD BE PREPARED TO JOIN IN EITHER VOTING NO OR ABSTAINING. IN ANY EVENT, [[WE||1]]  WOULD WANT TO MAKE A STRONG STATEMENT OF EXPLANATION.
