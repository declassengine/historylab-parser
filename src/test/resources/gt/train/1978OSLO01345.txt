ATURE OF MOU



1. DURING A MARCH 16 CONVERSATION WITH [[THE AMBASSADOR || 1]], [[[[DEFENSE || 5]] UNDERSECRETARY JOHAN JORGEN HOLST || 2]] RAISED THE POSSIBILITY OF [[SECRETARY BROWN || 3]] SIGNING THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING DURING [[HIS || 3]] VISIT TO [[NORWAY || 4]]. [[HOLST ||2]] COMMENTED THAT IN [[HIS ||2]] VIEW MOST OF THE WORK HAD BEEN DONE BUT THAT THE ANNEXES NEED A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION. (IN A SEPARATE CONVERSATION, [[[[MOD || 5]] HANSENS MIL. SEC. || 6 ]] CONFIRMED THAT FROM [[GON ||7]] PERSPECTIVE, MOU WAS RIPE FOR SIGNATURE). [[HOLTS ||2]] THOUGHT THAT A WELL-PUBLICIZED SIGNATURE CEREMONY IN [[NORWAY || 4]] BY [[THE TWO MINISTERS OF DEFENSE || 10]] WOULD HAVE A VERY GOOD EFFECT.


2. [[WE ||8]] AGREE WITH [[HOLST ||2]] THAT SIGNATURE OF THE MOU DURING THE [[SECRETARY'S || 9]] VISIT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT REFLECTION OF [[OUR || 11]] BILATERAL DEFENSE RELATIONSHIP. IN LIGHT OF [[[[THE DEFMIN || 6]] STAFF'S ||5]] VIEW THAT NO PROBLEMS EXIST WITH THE TEXT, IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE INITIATIVE LIES WITH [[THE USG || 12]] TO COMPLETE THE WORK.


3. ACTION REQUESTED: APPRAISAL OF THE PRACTICALITY OF PURSUING THE MOU WITH AN EYE TOWARDS ITS SIGNATURE DURING [[SECRETARY BROWN'S  || 9]] APRIL 12 VISIT TO [[NORWAY || 4]].


[[LERNER || 1]]
