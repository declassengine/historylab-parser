[[FREEMAN || 1]] AND [[STEVE GREEN || 2]] ON [[UNA/USA ||3]] REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON DISASTER RELIEF.


FOLLOWING GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY [[STATE || 4]] AND [[AID || 5]] FOR MEETING SCHEDULED MONDAY AFTERNOON:


1.[[ ASSISTANT SECRETARY MAYNES || 6]] MET WITH [[FREEMAN || 1]] AND [[GREEN || 2]] ON JUNE 14 FOR A FULL AND VERY USEFUL REVIEW OF THE CON- TENT AND MAJOR RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE VALUABLE [[UNA || 3]] STUDY.


2. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT [[FREEMAN || 1]] AND [[GREEN || 2]]  WILL WISH TO BRING [[AMBASSADOR LEONARD || 7]] UP TO DATE ON THE STUDY WITH WHICH [[HE || 7]]  IS OF COURSE COMPLETELY FAMILIAR. (FYI. [[USG || 8]] MORE AT A LISTENING THAN COMMENTING STAGE RIGHT NOW.)


3. [[AMBASSADOR LEONARD || 7]]  SHOULD EXPRESS THE GRATITUDE OF [[THE USG || 8]]  AT THE CARE AND THOROUGHNESS WITH WHICH THE COM- MITTEE HAS LOOKED INTO THIS CRUCIAL ISSUE OF DISASTER ASSISTANCE. [[WE || 8]] BELIEVE IT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE CONTINUING PROBLEMS AND THE NEED FOR STRENGTHENING THE CURRENT SYSTEM.


4. THE REPORT IS CURRENTLY UNDER CAREFUL REVIEW ON AN URGENT BASIS IN [[AID||5]] AND [[THE STATE DEPARTMENT || 4]] AND [[OUR || 8]] POSI- TION ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL FOLLOW THIS REVIEW.


5. [[WE || 8]] SHARE THE SENSE OF URGENCY FOR TAKING FURTHER STEPS TO IMPROVE THE PREPAREDNESS AND INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES, BOTH NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, TO MEET DISASTER SITUATIONS MORE QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY AND, IN FACT, ARE EVEN NOW DEEPLY ENGAGED IN THOSE AREAS.


6. 1977 [[UNGA || 9]] DISCUSSIONS OF RECOMMENDED FUTURE STEPS MAY BE USEFUL, ALTHOUGH IT WILL PROBABLY BE EARLY TO EXPECT SUBSTANTIVE DECISIONS AT THAT TIME.


7. FYI. ADDITIONAL [[U.S. || 8]] FUNDING IN THIS AREA MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AT THE APPROPRIATE FUTURE TIME.
