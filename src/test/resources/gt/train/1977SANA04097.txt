BEGIN SUMMARY: THOUGH [[GHASHMI || 1]] HAS SURVIVED FOR A WEEK [[HE||1]] FACES ACUTE SECURITY AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS. [[HE||1]] IS MOVING TO MEET BOTH APPARENTLY BUTH WHETHER [[HE||1]] IS MOVING QUICKLY AND ADROITLY ENOUGH REMAINS TO BE SEEN. END SUMMARY.



1. IN [[HIS || 1]] FIRST WEEK OF OFFICE [[GHASHMI || 1]] SEEMS, AGAINST ALL ODDS, TO HAVE LINED UP MOST MAJOR UNIT COMMANDERS WITH HIM. [[HE || 1]] AT LEAST DOES NOT FACE OPEN OPPOSITION FROM ANY MILITARY QUARTER AND HAS A SOLID BASE OF SUPPORT IN CERTAIN KEY UNITS LIKE [[HIS || 1]] OLD [[SANA ||2]] ARMORED GROUP. KEY COMMANDERS HAVE APPEARED AT [[HIS || 1]] SIDE IN PUBLIC. THERE IS STILL POTENTIAL FOR INTRA-[[ARMY || 3]] CONFLICT OF SORT WHICH ALL [[SANA ||2]] HAS BRACED [[ITSELF ||2]] FOR THIS WEEK. WEEK OF CALM COULD HAVE BEEN WEEK OF CONSPIRACY WHICH [[WE || 4]] WOULD NOT DISCOVER UNTIL COALITION OF ANTI-[[GHASHMI || 1]] U ITES MOVES AGAINST [[HEADQUARTERS ||2]]. NEVERTHELESS, [[WE ||4]] VENTURE TO TAKE MORE OPTIMISTIC VIEW AND SAY THAT PERIOD OF WORST SECURITY CRISIS HS PASSED WITH RESULTS THAT ARE BASICALLY FAVORABLE TO [[GHASHMI || 1]]; THAT IS, [[HE || 1]] IS STILL ALIVE AND IN POWER.


2. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT [[PDRY ||5]] WAS CAUGHT FLAT- FOOTED BY MURDERS, AND IMMEDIATELY ALERTED UNITS AND MOVED SOME FORCES TOWARDS NORTHERN BORDER. MOVES APPEAR DEFENSIVE, AND WERE QUICKLY SHUT DOWN, ACCORDING TO [[UK|| 6]] REPORTING OUT OF [[ADEN|| 2]]. NO ONE DOUBTS HOPE AND ABILITY OF [[SOUTH YEMEN ||5]] TO EXPOLIT INSTABILITY [[HERE|| 2]] AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LEAFLETS, WALL WRITINGS, TALK OF DEMONSTRATIONS LED BY [[NASSERIST || 7]] AND OTHER ELEMENTS WHO HAVE FOLLOWING AMONG YOUTH. ALL THESE ANTI- [[GHASHMI || 1]], ANTI-[[WEST || 8]] AND ANTI-[[US || 9]] LINE. HOWEVER, IMMEDIATE SECURITY THREAT OF THESE ACITIVITIES DOES NOT SEEM GREAT. [[GHASHMI’S || 1]] REACTION MOREOVER, IS LIKELY TO BE FAIRLY HARSH.


3. [[WE ||4]] HAVEN'T HEARD FROM TRIBES, WHICH MAY BE BEST NEWS OF ALL. [[GHASHMI || 1]] COULDN'T COPE WITH PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD ARISE FROM ANY EFFORT OF TRIBAL FORCES TO MOVE SOUTH TOWARD [[CAPITAL||2]].


4. THUS, WITH [[ARMY ||3]] APPARENTLY IN HAND AND [[SOUTH || 5]] AND [[NORTH || 2]] NOT MOUNTING IMMEDIATE SECURITY THREAT, [[GHASHMI || 1]] APPARENTLY HAS LAID THE BASIS FOR POLITICAL RECONSTRUCTION. [[HE || 1]] MUST, HOWEVER, ESCAPE ASSASSINATION. THIS IS PERHAPS [[HISI || 1]] GREATEST SECURITY THREAT AT MOMENT. [[HAMDI ||11]] COULD NOT ESCAPE IT, DE- SPITE [[HIS ||11]]  MUCH GREATER POPULARTIY AND POLITICAL SOPHISTICATION. IT IS TRUE THAT POLITICAL ASSASSINATION WITHIN [[YEMEN||2]] IS RARE BUT EVERY MAN CARRIES WEAPONS IN CONCEALED OR OPEN FASHION. ([[YEMENIS  ||10 ]] HAVE BEEN KILLED OUTSIDE OF [[YEMEN || 10]] OF COURSE.) IN IN- FLAMED CIRCUMSTANCES OF OPINION IN [[SANA || 2]] TODAY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO RULE OUT ANOTHER ATTEMPT LIKE YESTERDAY'S, PARTICULARLY BY SORROWING AND ANGRY SUPPORTER OF [[HAMDI ||11]] .


5. INCIDENTALLY, [[ZAID AL-KIBSI ||13]] (WHO TRIED KILL [[GHASHMI || 1]] YESTERDAY) HAS BEEN RELIABLY IDENTIFIED AS LONG-TIME ANTAGONIST AND CRITIC OF [[HAMDI || 11]], NOT SUPPORTER, AND MANY IN [[GOVERNMENT || 12]] ARE ASSUMING THAT [[HIS ||13]] ACT WAS IN SOME WAY FOLLOWUP TO MURDER OF [[PRESIDENT || 11]]. IN ANY CASE, WITH [[REAL (THOUGH DEAD) PERSON || 11]] TO INVESTIGATE, FRIENDS, TRAVEL, HISTORY, POLITICAL VIEWS OF [[KIBSI ||13]], A [[SAYYID|| 14]], ARE BEING EX- HAUSTIVELY LOOKED INTO TODAY. IT'S NOT A GOOD DAY ON WHICH TO HAVE DESCENDED FROM [[THE PROPHET || 15]].


6. ON PERHAPS OPTIMISTIC ASSUMPTION THAT [[GHASHMI || 1]] IS NOT ELIMINATED IN NEXT TWO WEEKS, TASKS OF POLITICAL RECONSTRUCTION WOULD SEEM TO FALL INTO SEVERAL CATEGORIES, ACCORDING VARIOUS [[YEMENIS || 10]]. FIRST CONCERNS REKINDLING OF POLITICAL CONFIDENCE AND RELATES DIRECTLY TO INVESTIGATION OF KILLING. IN CONSPIRATORIAL ATMOSPHERE OF [[YEMEN ||10]], [[GHASHMI || 1]] WILL PROBABLY NEVER EXONERATE [[HIMSELF ||1]], BUT [[HE||1]] MUST REDUCE BY LARGE PERCENTAGE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO ARE CONVINCED [[HE||1]] DID IT. SEPTEL STATES [[OUR ||4]] VIEWS ON THIS SUBJECT. WHATEVER THE FACTS, HOW- VER, [[GHASHMI || 1]] CAN'T REALLY RUEL IF BLAME DOESN'T SHIFT IN OTHER DIRECTION. THIS IS BASIS OF GOVERN- MENT EVEN IN [[ARMY|| 3]]-RUN STATE LIKE [[YEMEN || 2]].


7. SECOND, AND MORE IMMEDIATE, [[HE||1]] MUST GATHER GROUP OF CIVILIAN ADVISOR AROUND [[HIM ||1]]. [[HE||1]] HAS NO SUCH CLIQUE TO HELP WITH VARIOUS PROBLEMS OF [[STATE||2]] . [[HE||1]] NEVER HAD TO OR WANTED TO DEAL WITH SUCH PROBLEMS BEFORE. [[AHMAD ABDU || 16]] SAID SAYS [[GHASHMI || 1]] HAS APPOINTED KIND OF KITCHEN CABINET OF [[HIMSELF ||1]], [[BASINDWA||17]],[[ ASNAJ||18]] AND [[PRIME MINISTER || 19]] TO ADVISE [[HIM ||1]] ON GENERAL QUESTIONS OF SECURITY, ECONOMY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS. [[GHASHMI ||1]] DOES NOT SEEM TO WANT TO CHANGE [[GOVERNMENT || 20]] EVEN THOUGH [[PRIME MINISTER ||19]] IS SHATTERED AND FEARFUL MAN WHO REALLY CAN'T GIVE ADVICE. FOR MOMENT [[GHASHMI || 1]] APPEARS TO WANT TO RE- START [[GOVERNMENT || 20]] OPERATIONS WITH PERSOMS WHO MOST FAMILIAR WITH MINISTRIES.


8. THIRD, THERE IS TALK OF EXPANDING [[THE COMMAND COUNCIL || 21]], WHICH PRESENTLY HAS TWO [[SOUTHERNERS|| 5]] AND ONE [[NORTHERNER ||2]]. [[GHASHMI || 1]] DOESN'T WANT TO DO THIS EITHER, PARTLY TO AVOID PRESSURES TO ADD [[ABDALLAH BIN HUSAYN AL-AHMAR ||22]]. ANOTHER [[NORTHERNER || 2]] (LIKE [[REPUBLICAN WARHORSE ABDALLAH AL-RUHUMI || 23]], WHO ALSO [[HAMDIAN || 11]] LIKE [[GHASHMI || 1]]) MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO GIVE BETTER APPEARANCE OF BALANCE.


9. FOURTH, [[GHASHMI || 1]] MIGHT APPOINT LARGE ADVISORY COUNCIL WITH MEMBERS FROM ALL OVER [[YEMEN || 10]] AND FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE. WHAT THIS GROUP WOULD DO IS UNCLEAR BUT PERHAPS IT COULD LEND [[GHASHMI || 1]] SOME APPEARANCE OF SUPPORT. [[GHASHMI || 1]] REPORTEDLY IS RESISTING THIS TOO. [[HE|| 1]] PREFERS MEET WITH REPRESENTATIVE OF GROUPS LIKE [[ULEMA || 24]], OFFICER, ETC. HR SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE SENSE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS. COMMENT: SEPTEL DISCUSSES POLITICAL AND PERSONAL CHARACTER OF [[GHASHMI || 1]]. READ TOGETHER WITH ABOVE, IT IS PERHAPS CLEAR WHY [[WE ||4]] GIVE [[GHASHMI || 1]] SURPRISINGLY HIGH MARKS IN SECURITY, LOW MARKS IN POLITICS. NOTHING [[WE ||4]] KNOW NOW ABOUT [[GHASHMI || 1]] MAKES IT EASY TO BELIEVE [[HE||1]] IS QUICK ENOUGH OR ADROIT ENOUGH TO STAY ON TOP BY [[HIMSELF||1]], AS [[HAMDI||11]] DID.
