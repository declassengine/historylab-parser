1. [[DEPARTMENT || 1]] CONGRATULATES [[EMBASSY|| 2]] ON [[INDONESIAN || 3]] NPT ADHERENCE. [[WE || 1]] ARE DRAFTING CONGRATULATORY LETTER, HOPEFULLY FOR [[PRESIDENTIAL|| 4]] SIGNATURE, FOR DELIVERY BY [[THE AMBASSADOR|| 1]] TO [[PRESIDENT SUHARTO|| 7]].


2. GIVEN TIMING OF [[HABIBIE'S|| 6]] VISIT AND NPT ADHERENCE, [[WE || 1]] SUGGEST THAT [[POST || 2]] RAISE POSSIBILITY OF [[HABIBIE|| 6]] DEPOSITING INSTRUMENT OF RATIFICATION WHEN [[HE|| 6]] VISITS [[WASHINGTON || 8]]. DEPOSIT OF INSTRUMENT OF RATIFICATION AT A CEREMONY IN [[THE DEPARTMENT || 1]] COULD BE ONE OF THE HIGH POINTS OF [[HABIBIE'S|| 6]] VISIT AND MIGHT ATTRACT SOME MEDIA COVERAGE. IF INSTRUMENT OF RATIFICATION CAN NOT BE DRAWN UP IN TIME FOR [[HABIBIE'S|| 6]] VISIT, [[WE ||1]] WOULD PLAN A DEPOSIT CEREMONY IN ANY EVENT AT SUCH TIME AS [[GOI ||3]] WISHES. FYI: [[US || 5]], [[UK || 9]] AND [[USSR || 10]] ARE [[THE THREE DEPOSITARY GOVERNMENTS || 11]] FOR NPT. [[GOI ||3]] MAY DEPOSIT INSTRUMENT OF RATIFICATION WITH EITHER DEPOSITARY GOVERN- MENT OR [[ALL THREE || 11]]. END FYI.
