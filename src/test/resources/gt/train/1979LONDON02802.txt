1. THE WHITE PAPER "FARMING AND THE NATION" RELEASED LAST WEEK OUTLINES THE [[GOVERNMENT'S||1]] CURRENT POLICY TOWARD THE AGRICULTURE SECTOR. DESPITE DROUGHTS AND POLITICAL EVENTS IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THERE IS REMARKABLY LITTLE DIFFERENCE FROM THE GENERAL POLICY DIRECTION AS SET OUT IN THE PREVIOUS WHITE PAPER IN 1974 WHICH ADVOCATED "FOOD FROM OUR OWN RESOURCES" - GREATER SELF-SUFFICIENCY. THE WHITE PAPER'S ANALYSIS OF THE PRESENT ROLE AND POTENTIAL OF [[UK||2]] AGRICULTURE IS PROVOCATIVELY NATIONALIS- TIC. ALTHOUGH THE CAP IS REFERRED TO AND MENTIONED IN THE PAPER, THERE IS LITTLE RECOGNITION OF ANY SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD THE PROBLEMS OF THE CAP AND THE MEMBERSHIP IN [[THE COMMUNITY || 8]] APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BARELY A SECONDARY FACTOR IN THE ANALYSIS.


2. IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, THE PAPER FORECASTS A 9 PER- CENT GROWTH IN [[UK’S||2]] VOLUME OF AGRICULTURAL GROSS OUTPUT WITH A 5 PERCENT DROP IN REAL AGRICULTURAL PRICES. THE PAPER BACKS THE EXPANSION OF [[UK||2]] AGRICULTURE IN GENERAL, CITING MILK, CEREAL AND SUGAR WITH AREAS FOR THE GREATEST SCOPE OF EXPANSION OF [[HOME || 2 ]] PRODUCTION. THE PAPER ENCOURAGES PARTICULARLY THE GROWTH IN [[DOMESTIC || 2 ]] INDUSTRY'S SHARE OF BUTTER AND CHEESE [[DOMESTIC || 2 ]] MARKETS. IT PREDICTS FURTHER EXPANSION OF SUGAR BEET AREA AS THE CROP IS LIKELY TO REMAIN ECONOMICALLY ATTRACTIVE. THE PAPER PREDICTS GREATER SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN CEREALS AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND HIGHER YIELDING VARIETIES. REMARKABLY, THE PAPER STATES THAT "THE [[GOVERNMENT||1]] BELIEVES THAT THIS OBJECTIVE CAN BE ACHIEVED CONSISTENTLY WITH THE OPERATION OF THE CAP AND OUR OBLIGATIONS TO [[NEW ZEALAND | 3]]” AND THE [[LOME || 4]] CONVENTION.


3. ACCORDING TO THE PAPER, THE [[GOVERNMENT||1]] PLANS TO PERMIT MODERATE ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS IN THE GREEN POUND. PRICES IN REAL TERMS THEREFORE SHOULD REMAIN RELATIVELY CONSTANT FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. DURING THAT TIME, NET PRODUCT OF [[BRITISH||2]] AGRICULTURE IS FORECAST TO INCREASE IN VOLUME BY ABOUT 18 PERCENT. ACCORDING TO THE PAPER, [[UK||2]] AGRICULTURE SUPPLIES MORE THAN HALF [[THE COUNTRY'S || 2]] TOTAL FOOD SUPPLIES AND CONTRIBUTES ABOUT 2.5 PERCENT OF THE [[NATIONAL || 2 ]] INCOME WITH A SIMILAR PROPORTION OF THE WORKING POPULATION. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, THE [[GOVERNMENT||1]] EXPECTS CONSUMERS' TOTAL EXPENDITURE ON FOOD TO INCREASE OVER 1.5 PERCENT IN REAL TERMS.


4. IN THE PAPER, THE [[GOVERNMENT||1]] AGAIN STATES THAT THE ------------------008698 121412Z /46

BEST WAY TO IMPROVE THE CAP AND BALANCE SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS TO RESTRAIN COMMON PRICE LEVELS AND TO ENCOURAGE LOW- COST PRODUCTION. THE [[GOVERNMENT||1]] MAINTAINS THAT IT SEES NO INCONSISTENCY IN RESTRAINING HIGH-COST COMMUNITY PRODUCTION WHILE EXPANDING LOW-COST EFFICIENT PRODUCTION IN THE [[UK||2]]. "AN EFFECTIVE AGRICULTURAL POLICY SHOULD ENCOURAGE PRODUCTION IN THE AREAS BEST SUITED FOR IT." THE STATISTICAL BASIS OF [[UK||2]]’S EFFICIENCY COMPARA- BILITIES ARE VAGUE.


5. THE PRINCIPAL REASONS GIVEN TO JUSTIFY EXPANSION OF EFFICIENT [[HOME || 2 ]] AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION ARE LONG-TERM BENEFIT TO IMPROVEMENT OF BALANCE OF PAYMENTS, INSURANCE AGAINST UNEXPECTED SCARCITY IN A WORLD OF RAPIDLY GROWING POPULATION, AND ECONOMICS - THE MOST EFFICIENT ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES - OR IN SHORT, “[[NATIONAL || 2 ]] INTEREST."


6. COMMENTS: THE PRIMARY ROLE OF THE WHITE PAPER IS POLITICAL. ON THE SURFACE, IT MIGHT APPEAR THAT [[[[UK||2]] FARMERS || 6]] WOULD BE ENCOURAGED BY SUCH POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS BY THE [[GOVERNMENT||1]] IN [[THEIR || 6 ]] ABILITY TO EXPAND - PROFITABLY AND EFFICIENTLY. ON SECOND READING, IT MUST BE VERY DISTURBING INDEED TO ANY THINKING FARMERS THAT A MAJOR GOVERNMENT POLICY STATEMENT WOULD FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES IGNORE COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP AND TALK OF EXPANSION IN COMMODITIES SERIOUSLY IN COMMUNITY SURPLUS.  [[[[THE UK||2]] FARMER || 6]], FOR ALL [[HIS || 6 ]] TRAVELLING AND [[EUROPEAN || 13]] CONTACTS, CANNOT REALLY FIND COMFORT IN THE "MOST EFFICIENT" CASE THE [[UK GOVERNMENT||1]] PUTS SO STRONGLY AND REPEATEDLY. WITH TRULY COMMON PRICES, IMPORTS FROM [[THE COMMUNITY || 8]] LIKELY CAN COMPETE VERY EFFECTIVELY ON QUALITY AND COST WITH [[UK||2]] PRODUCTION. THE MOST POSITIVE AND ENCOURAGING POINT MADE IN THE PAPER WAS THE SUGGESTION OF GREATER ATTENTION TO AGRICULTURAL MARKETING.
