1. C - ENTIRE TEXT


2. SUMMARY: AS SEPTEMBER BEGINS [[NIMEIRI || 1]] IS FACING VERY FLUID SITUATION. SEPTEMBER COULD BE CRITICAL FOR [[NIMEIRI || 1]] DEPENDING ON REACTION TO ECONOMIC REFORMS AND POSSIBLE POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS INVOLVING [[SADEQ AL-MAHDI || 2]] . AT PRESENT HOWEVER, THERE ARE SEVERE FOOD AND GASOLINE SHORTAGES AND RUMORS OF STRIKES. IMPATIENCE OF PUBLIC IS BECOMING MANIFEST, BUT PUBLIC DESIRE IS AS MUCH FOR BETTER [[GOVERNMENT || 3]] AS FOR CHANGE IN [[GOVERNMENT || 3]]. PUBLIC IS STILL WAITING FOR [[[[NIMEIRI || 1]] GOVERNMENT || 3]] TO PRODUCE RESULTS. END SUMMARY


3. AUGUST HAS BEEN A DIFFICULT MONTH IN [[KHARTOUM || 4]] AND [[SUDAN || 4]]  GENERALLY, BUT IT ALSO HAS BEEN A MONTH DURING WHICH [[MAJOR GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL|| 3]] AND POLICY CHANGES WERE ANNOUNCED. PUBLIC DISATISFACTION OVER SEVERE SHORTAGES, INFLATION, DETERIORATION OF PUBLIC SERVICES AND NUMEROUS OTHER PROBLEMS PROVIDED BACKDROP FOR A WEEK OR SO OF DEMONSTRATIONS AND STRIKES INVOLVING SOME VIOLENCE DURING MID-AUGUST. AS IT HAPPENED [[SUDANGOV || 3]] HANDLED THESE CHALLENGES RATHER WELL AND [[NIMEIRI|| 1]] SURVIVED THIS LATEST CHALLENGE.


4. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT AUGUST 1979 EVENTS WERE INDEED A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO [[[[NIMEIRI || 1]] REGIME || 3]] NOTWITH- STANDING PARTICIPATION AND SUPPORT BY COMMUNISTS AND OTHER ENEMIES OF [[REGIME || 3]] WHOSE OWN POPULAR SUPPORT IS MINIMAL. THAT [[NIMEIRI|| 1]] REALIZES THIS IS EVIDENT BY MAJOR CABINET AND OTHER PERSONNEL CHANGES [[HE||1]] ANNOUNCED FOLLOWING MID-MONTH DEMONSTRATIONS AND IN [[HIS||1]] ANNOUNCEMENT OF A NEW FIFTEEN POINT ACTION PROGRAM WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE HANDLING OF [[SUDAN'S || 4]] ECONOMY. TYPICALLY, FOLLOWING AN IMPORTANT POLITICAL EVENT HERE,  [[NIMEIRI || 1]] HAS TRAVELLED TO [[SAUDI ARABIA || 5]] TO CONSULT AND PLEAD FOR AID WITH [[KING KHALID||6 ]] AND [[PRINCE FAHD ||7 ]] . [[HE||1]] HAS JUST RETURNED AND [[WE || 8]] DO NOT RPT NOT YET KNOW RESULTS OF [[HIS||1]] VISIT.


5. DESPITE [[HIS||1]]  QUICK RESPONSE TO AUGUST CHALLENGE, [[NIMEIRI|| 1]] REMAINS UNDER INTENSE PRESSURE. PARTLY BECAUSE OF LATE AUGUST RAINS WHICH HAVE DISRUPTED RAIL SYSTEM AND PERHAPS BECAUSE OF SABATAGE ALSO, THERE HAVE BEEN FOR PAST WEEK UNUSUALLY LONG LINES AT GASOLINE STATIONS. EVEN MORE EXPLOSIVE IS VIRTUAL ABSENCE OF MEAT IN [[KHARTOUM ||4]]. [[HILTON HOTEL || 9]] HAS HAD TO CLOSE ITS MAIN DINING ROOM BECAUSE OF LACK OF MEAT, AND FOR VIRTUALLY ALL RESIDENTS OF [[CAPITAL AREA || 4]], INCLUDING [[I || 10]] SHOULD NOTE [[EMBASSY EMPLOYEES || 8]], THERE IS HARDLY ANY RED MEAT ON (#) BLE IS SELLING FOR $10 - 15 PER POUND. IN ADDITION THERE ARE RUMORS OF MORE STRIKES, NOTABLY A GENERAL STRIKE WHICH COULD OCCUR SEPTEMBER 3 AND ANOTHER, LONGER RAIL WORKERS STRIKE WHICH IS SLATED FOR SEPTEMBER 15. IT STILL NOT RPT NOT CERTAIN THAT EITHER THESE OR OTHER (DOCTORS, BANK WORKERS) STRIKES WILL ACTUALLY TAKE PLACE. FOR NOW THERE ARE ONLY RUMORS, AND [[WE|| 8]] KNOW OF NO PLAN FOR ORGANIZED STRIKE OVER NEXT WEEK. FYI THERE IS A STRIKE OF SORTS OF STUDENTS AT [[KHARTOUM UNIVERSITY || 11]] OVER LOCAL ISSUES END FYI. NEVERTHELESS, RUMORS ALONE ARE FEEDING PUBLIC NERVOUSNESS AND DISCONTENT.

6. IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO SAY WHETHER ENOUGH STEAM WAS RELEASED BY AUGUST EVENTS OR WHETHER [[NIMEIRI’S || 1]] PERSONNEL CHANGES AND NEW POLICIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO DEFLECT RISING PUBLIC FRUSTRATION AND ANGER OVER GENERAL SITUATION. WHAT PEOPLE WANT ARE FOOD AND GASOLINE, IF POSSIBLE AT REASONABLY PRICES. SO FAR [[ARMY|| 12]] LOYALTY SEEMS FIRM, ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT ALTOGETHER SURE THAT [[POLICE || 13]], WHO PERFORMED WELL IN AUGUST, WILL BE AS DEPENDABLE SHOULD PROBLEMS ERUPT IN SEPTEMBER.


7.[[ I || 10]] THINK IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT AS RECENTLY AS LAST WEEK [[SADEQ AL-MAHDI ||2]] HAS PUBLICLY ADVISED [[HIS ||2]] SUPPORTERS TO AVOID VIOLENCE AND IN GENERAL TO SUPPORT [[REGIME ||3]]. [[WE||8]] UNDERSTAND THAT POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNDERWAY BETWEEN [[NIMEIRI|| 1]] AND [[SADEQ ||2]] ALTHOUGH THE USUSAL OBSTACLES TO [[SADEQ ||2]] JOINING [[THIS GOVERNMENT ||3]] PRESUMABLY EXIST. THIS IS BECAUSE TO A LARGE EXTENT THESE OBSTACLES ARE FUNCTION OF  [[NIMEIRI'S || 1]] AND [[SADEQ’S ||2]] PERSONALITIES. HOWEVER, EACH MAN IN HIS OWN WAY IS A PATRIOT AND IS CONCERNED OVER CURRENT SITUATION. THEREFORE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT COMPROMISES MAY BE POSSIBLE NOW THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FEASIBLE SEVERAL WEEKS OR MONTHS AGO.


8. THUS, AS SEPTEMBER BEGINS, SITUATION IS FLUID AND UNCERTAIN. LACK OF FOOD AND GASOLINE AS WELL AS OTHER PERSISTENT AND HIGHLY ANNOYING PROBLEMS ARE LEADING TO INTENSIFYING PRESSURES ON [[[[NIMEIRI|| 1]] REGIME||3]]. THERE ARE THREATS OF STRIKES, AND EXPECTATION OF TROUBLE CAUSED EITHER BY [[NIMEIRI'S || 1]] ANTAGONISTS OR BY DISGRUNTLED MERCHANTS, WORKERS AND OTHERS. HOWEVER, IMPORTANT CHANGES ARE UNDERWAY AND POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS MAY ALSO TAKE PLACE SOON. [[WE||8]]  THINK TO A LARGE EXTENT PUBLIC WANTS BETTER [[GOVERNMENT||3]] RATHER THAN CHANGES PER SE. PUBLIC PATIENCE IS VERY THIN, AND THE KEY QUESTION IS WHETHER IT WILL LAST LONG ENOUGH FOR SOME OF  [[NIMEIRI'S || 1]] RECENT CHANGES TO BEGIN TO HAVE SOME NOTICEABLE EFFECT. PUBLIC IS WAITING FOR [[[[NIMEIRI|| 1]] GOVERNMENT || 3]] TO PRODUCE RESULTS.
