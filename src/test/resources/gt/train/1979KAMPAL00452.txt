1. CONFIDENTIAL - ENTIRE TEXT.


2. SUMMARY. [[[[TANZANIAN || 1]] LIAISON OFFICER  || 2]] SAID [[TANZANIAN AUTHOR- ITIES ||1]] ARE WELL AWARE OF PROBLEMS IN [[RUWENZORI NATIONAL PARK || 3]] AND ATTEMPTING TO REESTABLISH CONTROL. DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS WITH [[TANZANIAN SOLDIERS ||4]] ELSEWHERE ARE INCREASING. PROVIDING [[ARMED FORCES ||4]] TO PROTECT [[UGANDA ||5]] IS BECOMING A GREATER BURDEN FOR [[TANZANIA || 1]] THAN FORESEEN BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE NO ALTERNATIVE. END SUMMARY.


3. [[CHARGE  || 7]] MET AUGUST 20 WITH [[OUTGOING  [[TANZANIAN || 1]]  LIAISON OFFICER LWENO || 2]] , WHO IS RETURNING TO DUTIES IN [[AFRICA || 8]]  AND [[MIDDLE EAST  || 9]] DIVISION IN [[MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS  || 10]] IN [[DAR ES SALAAM || 6]] . [[HE || 2]]  WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED WITH [[UGANDA || 5]]. [[[[HIS || 2]] SUCC- ESSOR  ||11 ]] WILL BE [[PARAJI KILUMANGA || 11]], RECENTLY [[COUNSELOR OF [[TANZANIA'S EMBASSY AT [[THE HAGUE || 13]] || 12]] || 11]] .


4. [[LWENO || 2]] SAID [[HE || 2]] HAD FOUND [[KAMPALA || 5]] A CHALLENGING ASSIGNMENT AS [[HE || 2]] HAD HAD NO PREVIOUS CONTACT WITH [[[[TANZANIA'S ||1]]  ARMED FORCES || 4]] BUT [[HE || 2]] INDICATED THAT [[HE || 2]] IS DISTURBED BS THE DETERIORATION IN DISCIPLINE AMONG [[[[TANZANIAN ||1]] TROOPS  || 4]] ACROSS THE BOARD. [[HE || 2]] AGREED THAT THE KILLING OF WILDLIFE IN [[RUWENZORI PARK || 3]] IS A PARTICULARLY SERIOUS PROBLEM, SO MUCH SO THAT [[MAJOR GENERAL MAYUNGA || 14]] (WHO COMMANDS [[TPDF FORCES ||4]] IN [[UGANDA || 5]]) IS [[HIMSELF ||14]] VISITING [[THE PARK || 3]] TO INVESTIGATE. [[LWENO || 2]] SAID [[TROOPS||4]] [[THERE ||3 ]] WILL BE REASSIGNED AND THOSE INVOLVED IN POACHING WILL BE PUNISHED.


5. [[LWENO ||2]] SAID A GOOD NUMBER OF [[[[TANZANIAN ||1]] SOLDIERS ||4]] ARE BEING HELD IN [[LUZIRA PRISON (AT PORT BELL, OUTSIDE [[KAMPALA ||5]] ) || 15]] FOR A VARIETY OF OFFENCES. [[HE || 2]] WAS UNWILLING TO SAY HOW MANY ARE BEING HELD, WHICH MAY MEAN A LARGE NUMBER. [[HE || 2]] SAID THAT THERE IS A PLAN FOR DEALING WITH UNNECESSARY SHOOTING AT NIGHT IN [[KAMPALA ||5]]. WHEN [[MOBILE TPDF PATROLS  ||4]] HEAR SHOOTING [[THEY ||4]]  GO TO THE SCENE AND CHALLENGE THE OFFENDER. IF THE OFFENDER ANSWERS UP, HE IS ARRESTED. IF THERE IS NO ANSWER THE OFFENDER IS RECKONED TO BE A "BAD ELEMENT" AND IS KILLED IF POSSIBLE. ([[WE || 16]] IMAGINE THIS PLAN EXISTS MORE IN THEORY THAN IN PRACTICE).


6. [[LWENO ||2]] SAID [[HE || 2]] HAD HAD SEVERAL CHANCES TO TRAVEL IN [[NORTHERN UGANDA || 18]] SINCE HIS ARRIVAL IN MAY. [[HE || 2]] CONFIRMED SEVERE HARD- SHIPS BEING FACED BY [[THE PEOPLE OF [[KARAMOJA || 5]] || 17]]. SECURITY IS NOT A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN [[THE NORTH || 18]], [[HE||2]] SAID. [[HE || 2]] DISMISSED AS UNFOUNDED [[UGANDAN || 5]] ALLEGATIONS OF A BUILD-UP OF [[PRO-[[AMIN || 19]] FORCES || 29]] IN [[SOUTHERN SUDAN || 20]]. [[[[AMIN'S  || 19]] MEN || 29]] ARE SCATTERED IN THE [[NORTH||18]] IN SMALL GROUPS WHICH EMERGE EVERY NOW AND THEN TO LOOK FOR FOOD, HARASSING PEOPLE IN RURAL AREAS. [[HE || 2]] DID NOT THINK THERE IS ANY COHESION IN THE REMNANTS OF [[[[AMIN'S || 19]] ARMY || 29]] BUT MENTIONED OCCASIONAL SKIRMISHES BETWEEN [[TANZANIANS || 4]] AND [[[[AMIN'S || 19]] SOLDIERS || 29]] ALONG THE [[ZAIRE BORDER || 21]] IN [[SOUTHWESTERN UGANDA || 22]].


7. [[LWENO ||2]] IS EXPECTING A [[HIGH-LEVEL [[TANZANIAN ||1]] DELEGATION || 23]] AT THE END OF THE WEEK TO PIN DOWN AN AGREEMENT WITH [[UGANDA || 24]] ON [[[[TANZANIAN ||1]] MILITARY || 4]] SUPPORT. [[HE || 2]] SAID THE BURDEN OF PROTECTING [[UGANDA ||5]] IS GREATER THAN FORESEEN AND THAT [[NYERERE'S ||25]] WORDS AT THE [[LUSAKA || 26]] [[COMMONWEALTH || 30]] MEETING ABOUT FINDING SOMEONE ELSE TO DO THE JOB WERE NOT RHETORIC. [[LWENO ||2]]  SAID [[TANZANIA || 1]] IS UNDER GREAT PRESSURE FROM OTHER [[AFRICAN || 8]] COUNTRIES TO SEND [[[[ITS||1]] FORCES ||4]] [[HOME || 6]] BUT [[HE ||2]] SEES NO ALTERNATIVE TO [[[[TANZANIAN ||1]] SOLDIERS ||4]]  STAYING ON UNTIL [[UGANDA'S || 5]] POLICE AND ARMY CAN PROVIDE ADEQUATE SECURITY. [[HE || 2]] DID NOT SEEM TO THINK THAT THERE IS MUCH CHANCE OF A MULTI- LATERAL FORCE - [[UN || 27]] OR [[COMMONWEALTH ||30]] - STEPPING IN BUT WAS INTERESTED IN THE IDEA.


8. HAVE JUST SEEN [[DAR ES SALAAM || 6]] 3910. [[MAYUNGA'S || 14]] [[PARK || 3]] VISIT DOUBTLESS A RESULT OF [[EMBASSY [[DAR ES SALAAM'S|| 6 ]]  28]] EFFORT. [[TANZANIA || 6]] INDEED HAS A DISTINGUISHED WILDLIFE CONSERVATION RECORD. [[LWENO ||2]] MENTIONED THAT IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT IT HAS BEEN COMPROMISED BY A FEW ERRANT INDIVIDUALS. [[WE || 16]] WILL MONITOR PROGRESS ON THIS END ALTHOUGH SOME [[UGANDANS || 6]] CLOSELY CONCERNED WITH [[THE PARK || 3]] BELIEVE [[IT || 3]] MAY NEVER RECOVER FROM DAMAGE ALREADY DONE.
