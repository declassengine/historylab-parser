1. [[WE || 1]] TOO ARE SOMEWHAT PUZZLED BY THE PROCESS EMPLOYED BY [[SUDANGOV|| 2]] TO DETERMINE DEVELOPMENT BUDGET FOR 1978-79. METHOD OF DETERMINING DEVELOPMENT FUNDING IS NEW, PRESENT- ATION BY THE [[MINNATPLAN||6]] IS NOVEL, AND [[PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY||3]] IS STILL FEELING [[ITS||3]] WAY AS A PLAYER IN THE BUDGET PROCES- AS A RESULT, THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROCESS MAY WELL BE AS UNCERTAIN OF THE OUTCOME AS [[WE || 1]] ARE. [[WE || 1]] MANAGED TO CLARIFY SOMEWHAT THE SITUATION DESCRIBED REF A, AND WITHOUT STICKING OUT [[OUR ||1]] NECK TOO FAR, SUGGEST THAT BUDGET STILL FOLLOWS A PATH REFLECTING RESTRAINT IN EXPENDITURE WHICH SHOULD MEET [[IMF||4]] REQUIREMENTS.


2. AS [[WE || 1]] NOW UNDERSTAND SITUATION, [[MINFIN || 5]] PRESENTED THE ACUTAL BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR DEVELOPMENT AND THE FIGURES [[HE|| 5]] OFFERED INDICATE THE AMOUNT WHICH [[THE MINFIN|| 5]] WILL PROVIDE TO [[MINNATPLAN||6]] FOR DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL IS NOW BEING DEBATED IN [[THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY|| 3]]. THERE HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CRITICISM OF THE BUDGET IN [[THE ASSEMBLY|| 3]] (MOST REPRESENTATIVES ARE LOOKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR THEIR OWN PROVINCES, ALTHOUGH MORE GENERAL CRITICISM OF THE PROPOSAL'S INADEQUATE ATTENTION TO DEVELOPMENT HAS ALSO BEEN VOICED), AND DEBATE WILL LAST FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER WEEK. WHILE [[ASSEMBLY MEMBERS || 3]] SEEM TO ENJOY OPPORTUNITY TO LAMBASTE VARIOUS [[GOVERNMENT || 2]] PROGRAMS AND AIR [[THEIR|| 3]] GRIEVANCES IN A FORUM WHICH GARNERS [[THEM|| 3]] SUBSTANTIAL PUBLICITY, [[WE || 1]] EXPECT [[FINMIN'S || 5]] BUDGET PROPOSAL TO BE APPROVED. APPROVAL SHOULD COME SOMETIME AFTER JUNE 24.


3. ALONG WITH, BUT SEPARATE FROM, PRESENTATION OF THE GENERAL BUDGET EACH YEAR, [[MINNATPLAN||6]] IS REQUIRED TO PRESENT THE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM TO [[THE PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY|| 3]]. THIS YEAR [[HE|| 7]] CHOSE TO PRESENT THE PROGRAM ON THE SAME DAY AS THE [[FINMIN'S ||5]] BUDGET SPEECH, AND INCLUDED [[HIS ||7]] OWN ESTIMATE OF THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THIS PROGRAM. THIS CAUSED THE CONFUSION REPORTED REF A. [[WE || 1]] DO NOT KNOW IF THIS ACTION WAS A PLOY BY THE [[MINNATPLAN||6]], OR MERE HAPPENSTANCE. AT ANY RATE, [[PEOPLE'S ASSEMBLY||3]] HAS NOW APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. THE [[MINNATPLAN||6]] BUDGET FIGURES NOW BECOME THE 'RECOMMENDED' ONES FOR DEVELOPMENT, BUT ACTUAL EXPENDITURE WILL BE DETERMINED WHEN [[FINMIN ||9]]  BUDGET IS APPROVED. IN A SENSE THEN, [[MINNATPLAN||6]] FIGURES REPRESENT THE AUTHORIZATION FOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM; [[MINFIN ||9]] FIGURES REPRESENT THE APPROPRIATION.


4. THIS MAY NOT BE THE END OF THE STORY THOUGH. [[THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL PLANNING || 7]] CLOSED [[HIS||7]] SPEECH WITH THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT: "[[WE|| 9]] WILL SPARE NO EFFORTS AND LEAVE NO STONE UNTURNED IN A ZEALOUS PURSUIT TO INCREASE THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES FOR THE FULL EXECUTION OF THE PRO- POSED PROGRAM FOR 1978-79, HOPING TO COME BACK TO [[YOUR ESTEEMED ASSEMBLY ||3]] ASKING FOR THE ENACTMENT OF A LAW AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURE ON ADDITIONAL ALLOCATION..." [[FINMIN||9]], HOWEVER, HAS ELIMINATED SUPPLEMANTAL APPROPRIATIONS IN COMING FISCAL YEAR. ENACTMENT OF A LAW GRANTING SUPPLEMENT FOR DEVELOPMENT WOULD CIRCUMVENT THIS. [[FINMIN ||9]] MAY WELL CARRY THE DAY, BUT [[MINNATPLAN||6]] CAN BE EXPECTED TO PRESS [[ITS||6]] CASE. SINCE PREPONDERANT SHARE OF DEVELOPMENT BUDGET MUST BE FINANCED BY [[CENTERAL BANK||8]] BORROWING, [[MINNATPLAN||6]] CAN ARGUE THAT A LARGER DEVELOPMENT BUDGET WILL MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. [[IMPARTIAL [[WORLD BANK|| 10]] ADVISOR TO [[MINNATPLAN||6]] ||11]] ALSO CONTENDS THAT [[MINFIN ||9]] BUDGET FOR LOCAL CURRENCY DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES WILL BE INADEQUATE IF HOPED-FOR LEVEL OF FOREIGN CONTRIBUTION TO DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM MATERIALIZES. IF THIS IS TRUE, AND FOREIGN CONTRIBUTORS ARE FORTHCOMING, PRESSURE FOR INCREASE IN LOCAL 'MATCHING'FUNDS WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT.


5. IN A NUTSHELL,[[ NIMERI ||12]] CAN STILL CLAIM TO BE THE CHAMPION OF FISCAL RESTRAINT, BUT WITH RIGHT HOOKS AND LEFT JABS FROM A VARITY OF INTERESTS LED BY [[MINNATPLAN||6]], [[WE || 1]] CANNOT SAY HOW LONG [[HE||12]] WILL WEAR THE CROWN.
