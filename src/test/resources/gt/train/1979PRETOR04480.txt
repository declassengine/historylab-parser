1. (C-ENTIRE TEXT)




2. [[PRIME MINISTER-DESIGNATE BISHOP MUZOREWA || 2]] HAS YET TO GIVE ANY FORMAL INDICATION OF WHICH INDIVIDUALS OR PARTIES WILL RECEIVE WHICH PORTFOLIOS IN [[THE NEW ZIMBABWE GOVERN- MENT || 3]]. TECHNICALLY , [[THE PRIME MINISTER'S || 2]] POWER EXTENDS ONLY TO ALLOCATING A GIVEN PORTFOLIO TO A SPECIFIC PARTY; IT IS UP TO THE PARTY TO NAME AN INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE IT. NEVER- THELESS, [[THE BISHOP|| 2]] WILL PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN DE- TERMINING THE PERSONALITIES IN [[HIS|| 2]] FIRST CABINET: AS [[HEAD OF [[THE UANC || 4]] || 2]] [[HE|| 2]] HAS DIRECT SAY IN FILLING TEN OF THE POSTS AND AS [[PRIME MINISTER || 2]] [[HE|| 2]] CAN EXERT CONSIDERABLE INFLUENCE OVER THE OTHER PARTIES IN ARRANGING FOR SELECTED INDIVI- DUALS TO BE NAMED.




3. IN RECENT DAYS [[WE|| 5]] HAVE HEARD INCREASED SPECULATION -- BOTH IN THE PRESS AND THROUGH INFORMAL TELEPHONE CONTACTS IN [[ RHODESIA || 6]] -- ON WHO WILL BE NAMED TO THE NEW CABINET. FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, FOLLOWING IS A SAMPLING OF THE MORE LIKELY POSSIBILITIES:
- --PRESIDENT: ALTHOUGH ELECTED BY THE TOTAL MEMBERSHIP OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE, [[MUZOREWA'S || 2]] VOICE WILL BE THE KEY ONE IN DETERMINING WHO WILL BE MADE PRESIDENT OF [[ZIMBABWE- RHODESIA || 7]]. IT IS GENERALLY CONCEDED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL WILL HAVE TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF [[THE MINORITY NDEBELE TRIBE || 8]]; AMONG THE NAMES  [[WE|| 5]]  HAVE HEARD MOST OFTEN IS THAT OF [[SENATOR CHIEF SIMON SIGOLA || 10]]. [[SIGOLA|| 10]] IS CONSIDERED A MODERATE AND IS PURPORTED TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO [[THE BISHOP|| 2]].
- --DEFENSE: [[MUZOREWA || 2]] REPORTEDLY DEPARTED FROM [[HIS|| 2]] PRE- PARED TEXT DURING A WEEKEND RADIO BROADCAST TARGETED AT CON- VINCING GUERRILLAS TO RETURN TO STATE THAT ONE REASON TO RETURN IS A BLACK MAN WOULD BE IN CHARGE OF DEFENSE. IN SPITE OF RUMORS THAT THE POST WOULD BE FILLED BY [[IAN SMITH || 11]](REFTEL),[[WE|| 5]]  BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE MOST DIFFICULT FOR [[MUZOREWA|| 2]]  TO DEPART FROM [[HIS|| 2]]  REPEATED PROMISE THAT IT WOULD BE FILLED BY A BLACK.




- --FINANCE: [[WE|| 5]] HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF REPORTS INDICATING THAT [[DAVID SMITH || 12]] HAS BEEN INDUCED BACK INTO POLITICS (AC- CORDING TO [[THE [[AFRIKAANS || 13]] NEWSPAPER BEELD || 14]], AT THE REQUEST OF [[THE UK || 15]] AND [[U.S. || 16]], AS WELL AS [[MUZOREWA ||2]] ) AND WILL ACCEPT THE FINANCE PORTFOLIO. [[SMITH || 12]]  IS WELL-RESPECTED; IN APRIL [[MUZOREWA ||2]] WAS QUOTED AS SAYING THAT "[[HE || 12]]  IS ONE OF THE FEW ([[RF || 27]] MEMBERS) [[WE|| 4]] HAVE LEARNED TO TRUST." [[SMITH'S || 12]]  EXPERIENCE WOULD BE AN INVALUABLE ASSET TO ANY NEW GOVERNMENT. HOW- EVER, GIVING [[HIM || 12]]  A MINISTERIAL JOB POSES CERTAIN DIFFICUL- TIES. ACCORDING TO THE CONSTITUTION, A MINISTER WHO IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE OR SENATE -- THE CASE WITH [[SMITH || 12]]  -- CAN ONLY HOLD OFFICE FOR FOUR MONTHS WITHOUT BE- COMING A MEMBER. IF [[HE || 12]]  WERE NAMED AS A SENATOR, THE DISQUALIFICATION WOULD DISAPPEAR, BUT SOME SOURCES SPECU- LATE THAT [[IAN SMITH || 11]] MIGHT OPPOSE [[HIS || 12]]  NOMINATION.




- --FOREIGN AFFAIRS: [[WE|| 5]] HAVE SEEN SEVERAL INTRIGUING REPORTS ([[BEELD ||14]] , [[RAND DAILY MAIL || 17]]) THAT [[MUZOREWA ||2]] INTENDS TO NAME [[JAMES KAMUFIKIRI, A [[RHODESIAN || 6]]-BORN ASSOCIATE PRO- FESSOR OF HISTORY AT [[CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AT POMONA || 20]] || 18]] AS [[HIS|| 2]] FOREIGN MINISTER. ACCORDING TO THE PRESS, THE TWO MET NEARLY 3O YEARS AGO AND BECAME GOOD FRIENDS DURING THE 16 MONTHS [[KAMUFIKIRI|| 18]] SPENT DURING RESEARCH IN [[RHODESIA|| 6]] IN THE MID-197O'S. ANOTHER NAME TIPPED FOR THIS PORTFOLIO IS [[THE FORMER [[NKOMO || 22]] LIEUTENANT (NOW [[UANC || 4]] ) GEORGE NYANDRO || 21]].
- --JUSTICE: [[[[THE UANC'S || 4]] SECRETARY FOR LEGAL AFFAIRS, SIMPSON MTAMBANENGWE ||23]], IS TOUTED AS THE BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE POST.




4. AS NOTED REFTEL, IF [[SITHOLE'S ||24]] TWELVE [[ZANU ||25]]  SEATS ARE NOT FILLED BY THE TIME THE MINISTERS ARE SWORN IN, PRE- LIMINARY LEGAL OPINION IS THAT [[ZANU'S || 25]] CLAIM ON [[ITS||25]] TWO PORTFOLIOS WILL BE FORFEITED. IN THAT EVENT, THE TWO POSITIONS WOULD BE REALLOCATED TO THE PARTIES REMAINING IN

MATHEMATICALLY. ONE ADDITIONAL SEAT WOULD GO TO [[THE UANC ||4]] (NEW TOTAL 11) AND THE SECOND WOULD GO TO [[THE RF || 27]] (NEW TOTAL 7). [[THE UNFP || 26]]  WOULD REMAIN WITH 2. [[WE|| 5]] DOUBT, HOWEVER, THAT THE RF AND [[UNFP || 26]] WOULD READILY AGREE TO SUCH A REALLOCATION, GIVING [[THE UANC ||4]] AN ABSOLUTE MA- JORITY IN THE CABINET AS WELL AS IN THE HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY. 5. [[MUZOREWA ||2]] HAS NOT ANNOUNCED WHEN [[HE || 2]] WILL MAKE [[HIS||2]]  DE- CISION ON THE ALLOCATION OF PORTFOLIOS KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC. IN ANY CASE, AN ANNOUNCEMENT IS EXPECTED BEFORE MAY 3O.
