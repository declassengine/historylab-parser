1. DURING [[MY || 8 ]] FEBRUARY 17 CALL ON [[STATE MINISTER WISCHNEWSKI || 1]] AT [[THE FEDERAL CHANCELLERY || 9]] [[HE || 1]] TOLD ME THAT [[THE HUNGARIANS || 2]] HAVE NOW PROPOSED THE FIRST HALF OF JULY 1977 FOR A VISIT BY [[PRIME MINISTER KADAR || 3]]. [[THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT || 4]], [[HE 1]] SAID, WELCOMES THE VISIT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING BILATERAL PROBLEMS AND [[WEST GERMAN OFFICIALS || 4]] HOPE THAT THE VISIT WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE [[WARSAW || 5]] PACT COUNTRIES || 11]]. [[WISCHNEWSKI || 1]] SAID [[HE || 1]] ASSUMED THAT T[[THE HUNGARIANS || 2]] HAD DISCUSSED THE MATTER OF TIMING OF THE [[KADAR ||3]] VISIT WITH THE [[SOVIETS || 6]] BEFOREHAND.


2. GIVEN THE TIMING OF THE [[KADAR ||3]]  VISIT,  [[WISCHNEWSKI || 1]] ADDED, [[HE || 1]] DID NOT EXPECT [[BREZHNEV || 7]] TO VISIT [[THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC |4]] | BEFORE THE FALL OF 1977. IN ADDITION, SUCH A VISIT WOULD HAVE TO BE MORE THAN A PROTOCOL VISIT AND THEREFORE THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING FOR THE [[SOVIETS|| 6]] TO DISCUSS WITH [[THE GERMANS || 4]] WHEN  [[BREZHNEV || 7]] CAME. AMONG OTHER REASONS FOR PUTTING OFF THE VISIT UNTIL LATER IN THE YEAR, [[WISCHNEWSKI || 1]]  BELIEVES, IS THAT [[THE SOVIETS || 6]] ARE NOT YET READY TO SIGN THE THREE OUTSTANDING [[FRG || 4]]-[[USSR || 6]] TREATIES WHICH ARE HUNG UP BECAUSE OF THE QUESTION OF INCLUDING [[ BERLIN || 10]].
