3. EXCEPT FOR EDITING TO REDUCE THE TEXT TO TWO PAGES, [[WE||14]] HAVE CLOSELY FOLLOWED [[THE EMBASSY'S ||4]] PROPOSED IMPLE- MENTATION PLAN (REFTEL). OMISSION OF ANY PARTICULAR ITEM DOES NOT IMPLY DISAPPROVAL. FOR EXAMPLE, [[WE||14]]  HAVE NOT MENTIONED S & T FUNDING, BECAUSE THE [[EMBASSY'S ||4]] ROLE IN FULFILLING THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE FINANCING OF SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGES AFTER 1981 CAN ONLY BE SUPPORTIVE OF [[THE DEPARTMENT'S ||14]] EFFORTS.
