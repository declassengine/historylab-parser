1. FIRST PERSON NOTE IN SPANISH CONVEYING TEXT IN REFTEL WAS DELIVERED JUNE 3 PERSONALLY TO [[FOREIGN MINISTER GUZMAN || 2]]. [[MINISTER || 2]] HAD BEEN IN [[COCHABAMBA || 3]] FOR SEVERAL DAYS AS HOST FOR [[FOREIGN MINISTERS OF [[CUENCA DE LA PLATA ORGANIZATION || 5]] || 6]]. ORAL COMMENTS IN PARA 3 REFTEL WERE ALSO MADE TO [[FOREIGN MINISTER ||  2]]. IN ADDITION, REMARKS WERE MADE TO [[THE FOREIGN MINISTER || 2]] ALONG THE LINES OF PARA 2 OF [[STATE||4]] 127952.


2. [[FOREIGN MINISTER ||  2]] EXPRESSED [[HIS || 2]] APPRECIATION FOR NOTE AND SAID THT TENSION ON [[GULF || 12]]  ISSUE HAD MARKEDLY DECREASED IN RECENT DAYS. [[HE ||2]] SAID [[PRESIDENT BANZER || 8]] WAS LESS CONCERNED THAN [[HE ||8]] HAD BEEN BEFORE. [[MINISTER ||  2]] SAID THAT [[HE|| 2]] HAS ADOPTED POSITION, WHICH [[HE|| 2]]  HAS BEEN ENCOURAGING [[PRESIDENT||8]] AND [[GOB || 9]] TO FOLLOW, OF PATIENCE AND CALM IN DEALING WITH THIS MATTER. [[MINISTER ||  2]] PERSONALLY BELIEVES THAT WHEN INFORMATION MADE AVAILABLE BY  [[GULF || 12]]  DIRECTLY OR THROUGH [[[[MCCLOY || 10  ]] COMMISSION||11]] RELEASE, [[GOB || 9]]  ACTIONS WILL BE TAILORED TO FIT THE SITUATION. FOR [[HIS || 2]] PART, [[HE ||2]] BELIEVES THAT THERE WERE PROBABLY NO ACTUAL ILLEGAL TRANSACTIONS IN [[BOLIVIA || 3]]. HE OFFERED [[HIS || 2]]  OWN VIEW THAT IT IS PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR [[BOLIVIA || 9]] TO UPSET THE INDEMNIFICATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH  [[GULF || 12]]  AND THAT IN ANY EVENT THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS TO EVEN BE CONTEMPLATED BY  [[THE GOB || 9]].


3. [[FOREIGN MINISTER ||  2]] SAID THAT [[HE|| 2]] WOULD BRIEF [[PRESIDENT BANZER||8]] ON CONTENTS OF NOTE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT SURELY WITHIN NEXT 24 HOURS.  [[HE|| 2]] GAVE NO EVIDENCE THAT  [[HE|| 2]] HAD RECEIVED ANY REPORT FROM [[WASHINGTON|| 7]] OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN [[AMB. CAPRILES || 14]] AND [[[[ARA || 16]] /[[BC || 17]] COUNTRY DIRECTOR || 15]] ON THIS SUBJECT.


4. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE ACTION TAKEN BY THE [[ACTING SECRETARY || 18]] IN TELEPHONING [[[[ GULF || 12 ]]CHAIRMAN DORSEY || 13]] JUNE 2 TO ENCOURAGE [[ GULF || 12 ]] TO BE MORE FORTHCOMING WITH [[THE GOB || 9]]. THIS ACTION WAS REPORTED IN [[STATE||4]] 127952. WHILE THE [[FOREIGN MINISTER'S || 2 ]] COMMENTS ARE REASSURING, [[HE || 2]] DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME POLITICAL SENSITIVITY AND CLOSE RAPPORT WITH [[PRESIDENT BANZER || 8]] THAT [[THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR || 20]] HAS. [[THE LATTER || 20]] HAS TOLD ME PERSONALLY OF THE COMPLEXITY AND DIFFICULTY OF THE [[DOMESTIC || 9]] POLITICAL SITUATION IF THERE IS NOT A CLARIFICATION BY  [[ GULF || 12 ]]  SOON.
