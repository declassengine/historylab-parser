SOLVE THE PROBLEM. [[ HE || 8]] SAID THAT THE AUTHENTICATION BY THE [[ MFA || 18]] OF STATEMENTS PREPARED BY PRIVATE FIRMS SHOULD NOT BE INTERPRETED BY EITHER [[ARABS||2]] OR [[ISRAELIS||1]] AS [[ GON || 5 ]] COOPEATION IN THE BOYCOTT.


4. [[BEGIN || 14]] TOLD [[ VAN DER KLAAUW || 8 ]] THAT [[ ISRAEL || 1]] WELCOMES [[ DUTCH || 5 ]] PARTICIPATION IN [[ UN IFIL || 11 ]] AND IS PREPARED TO COOPERATE WITH  [[THE [[DUTCH UNIT || 5]]; [[ HE || 14 ]] EXPECTS NO CLASHES BETWEEN [[[[ DUTCH || 5 ]] AND [[ ISRAELI || 1 ]] TROOPS || 13]].


[[ HE || 14]] ALSO SAID THAT [[ISRAEL || 1]] WOULD REGRET ANY ACTUAL [[ DUTCH || 5 ]]  CONTACT WITH [[THE PLO || 6]]. [[ VAN DER KLAAUW || 8 ]] RESPONDED THAT [[ THE [[DUTCH || 5 ]] UNIT || 19]] WILL BE UNDER [[UN||4]] COMMAND AND CONTACTS WITH BOTH [[ISRAELIS||1]] AND WITH [[THE PLO || 6]], AS FAR AS [[ THE [[UNIFIL UNIT  || 11 ]] IS CONCERNED, WOULD BE THROUGH [[UN||4]] CHANNELS. WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME INDIRECT CONTACT WITH [[THE PLO || 6]] IN THIS WAY, [[ THE GON || 5 ]] WILL HOLD TO NON-RECOGNITION.


5. PRESS ARTICLES NOTED [[ISRAELI || 1 ]] DISAPPOINTMENT THAT [[ THE NETHERLANDS || 5]] WOULD NOT AGREE TO SUPPORT [[ISRAEL'S || 1 ]] REQUEST FOR CLOSER [[EC || 15 ]] RELATIONS. [[ DUTCH OFFICIALS || 5]] ALSO RAISED THE CASE OF [[LUDWINA JANSEN || 7 ]] , [[THE [[DUTCH || 5]] GIRL || 7]] PRESENTLY SERVING A SIX YEAR SENTENCE FOR TERRORISM ACTIVITIES. [[ VAN DER KLAAUW || 8 ]] HAD INTENDED TO RAISE WITH BEGIN [[ DUTCH || 5 ]] OBJECTIONS TO [[ ISRAEL || 1]] SETTLEMENTS POLICY BUT NEGLECTED TO DO SO AND THIS SUBJECT WAS DISCUSSED BETWEEN OFFICIALS. THE PRESS STATED THAT [[ VAN DER KLAAUW || 8 ]] VISITED [[WEST JERUSALEM ||3]] "AND NOT THE EASTERN PART OF [[ THE CITY || 3]] , WHICH HAS BEEN ANNEXED BY [[ ISRAEL || 1]] AND WHICH WAS [[JORDANIANS || 9 ]]UNTIL 196/7."
