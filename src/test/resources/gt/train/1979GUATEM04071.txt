1. SECRET - ENTIRE TEXT


2. [[ I || 1 ]] MET [[FOREIGN MINISTER CASTILLO VALDEZ || 2]] AT THE AIRPORT ON [[HIS|| 2]] RETURN FROM [[WASHINGTON || 3]] YESTERDAY.  [[HIS|| 2]] COMMENTS ON THE [[NICARAGUA || 4]] RESOLUTION WERE PREDICTABLE: THAT IT CONTAINED ELEMENTS WHICH [[THE GOG || 5]] COULD SUPPORT, BUT ITS CALL FOR [[SOMOZA'S || 6]] DEPARTURE WAS INTERVENTION, THE LINE [[HE || 2]] ALSO TOOK IN A COMMUNIQUE TO THE PRESS WHICH APPEARED IN THIS MORNING'S PAPERS.


3. [[ I || 1 ]] ASKED [[HIM ||2]], WHAT NOW, TO WHICH [[HE || 2]] RESPONDED THAT THE FIGHTING AND THE KILLING WOULD CONTINUE.  [[ I || 1 ]] OBSERVED THAT IT LOOKED LIKE [[SOMOZA || 6]] HAD HAD IT. IF [[THE SANDINISTAS || 7]] DIDN'T GET [[HIM || 6]] NOW, THEY WOULD TRY AGAIN IN SIX MONTHS SO WHY WASN'T [[THE GOG || 5]]  MORE HELPFUL.  [[HE || 2]]  SUGGESTED THAT IF [[WE || 8]] HADN'T STARTED THE MEDIATION EFFORT LAST SEPTEMBER, NONE OF THIS WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.  [[ I || 1 ]] NOTED THAT [[WE || 8]] DIDN'T AGREE ON THAT POINT, BUT IN ANY CASE,  [[WE || 8]] COULDN'T GO BACK TO SEPTEMBER, SO WHAT WOULD [[HE || 2]] DO NOW? [[ I || 1 ]] DIDN'T GET A RESPONSE.


4. [[CASTILLO || 2]] IS, [[ I || 1 ]] THINK, FINALLY PERSUADED THAT [[WE || 8]] DON'T WANT A [[SANDINISTA || 7]] GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, [[ I || 1 ]] VERY MUCH GOT THE FEELING [[HE || 2]] EXPECTS [[THE USG ||8]] TO TAKE SOME UNILATERAL ACTION TO GET AN ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION.


5. [[JORGE SKINNER-KLEE, EX-FOREIGN MINISTER AND ADVISOR TO [[THE MINISTER || 2]] || 9]], WAS ALSO AT THE AIRPORT AND AGAIN EXPRESSED WISTFULLY [[HIS || 9]] PRIVATE DESIRE THAT [[THE USG ||8]] SOLVE IT. [[ I || 1 ]] AGAIN REPEATED THAT AFTER [[SANTO DOMINGO || 10]] AND [[VIETNAM || 11]], [[WE || 8]] WEREN'T GOING TO. [[THE OAS ||12]] MEETING WAS AN ATTEMPT TO GET A COLLECTIVE SOLUTION. IF [[WE || 8]] COULDN'T GET THE AGREEMENT AND COOPERATION OF THE OTHER [[LATIN NATIONS || 13]] AND THAT RESULTED IN A [[SANDINISTA || 7]] GOVERNMENT, SO BE IT. [[WE || 8]] DIN'T LIKE IT, BUT WERE PREPARED TO ACCEPT IT. [[HE|| 9]] RESPONDED THAT [[THE SANDINISTAS || 7]]  IN [[MANAGUA ||14]] MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE A GOOD THING AS THEY WOULD FINALLY ALL FEEL FREE TO INTERVENE THEN.


6. [[ I || 1 ]] WAS APPROACHED LAST NIGHT BY [[CARLOS ARIAS MASELLI , [[PRESIDENT OF CACIF || 16]] || 15]]. [[HE || 15]] SAID [[HIS|| 15]] BOARD HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT APPROACHING ALL [[THE [[CENTRAL AMERICAN || 18]] PRESIDENTS || 17]] AS WELL AS [[THE US EMBASSY || 19]] ABOUT THE [[ NICARAGUAN ||14]] SITUATION. [[WE || 8]] THEN WENT OVER MUCH OF THE ABOVE GROUND. [[HE || 15]]  SEEMED TO THINK  [[THE USG ||8]] WOULD FINALLY INTERVENE UNILATERALLY, SO [[ I || 1 ]]  SET [[HIM || 15]] STRAIGHT. AT ANY RATE [[ I || 1 ]] WILL BE MEETING WITH [[HIM || 15]] AND [[THE CACIF BOARD || 16]]  TODAY OR TOMORROW. [[ I || 1 ]] EXPECT IT TO BE LARGELY A REPEAT OF POINTS BOTH SIDES HAVE ALREADY MADE. IT MAY PROVE USEFUL, HOWEVER, IN GETTING [[CACIF || 16]] TO PUT PRESSURE ON [[THE GOG ||5]] TO GET OFF [[ITS || 5]] INTERVENTION LINE AND GET REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT THE ALTERNATIVE ARE.
