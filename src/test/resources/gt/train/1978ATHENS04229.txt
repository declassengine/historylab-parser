1. AFTER SHARP DEBATE, [[THE GREEK PARLIAMENT || 1]] RATIFIED BY VOICE VOTE THE AGREEMENT SIGNED DURING THE MAY 1977 VISIT OF [[[[ITALIAN || 3]] PRIME MINISTER ANDREOTTI || 4]] TO [[GREECE || 2]] (REF B) WHICH DELIMITS [[THE CONTINENTAL SHELF IN THE AREA OF THE SOUTHERN [[IONIAN SEA ||18 ]]  ||6 ]]  BETWEEN [[GREECE ||2]] AND [[ITALY ||8]]. IN ARGUING FOR RATIFICATION, [[GOG ||1]] SPOKESMAN UNDERLINED
-- THAT THE AGREEMENT SET A PRECEDENT AND INDICATED [[GREECE'S ||1]] WILLINGNESS TO SOLVE DISPUTES WITH ITS NEIGHBORS THROUGH PEACEFUL MEANS;
-- THAT [[ITS ||1]] TERMS ACCORDED WITH THE [[GREEK ||1]] POSITION FAVORING DELIMITATION THROUGH THE PRINCIPLE OF USING THE MEDIAN LINE;
-- THAT [[IT ||1]] TACITLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT ISLANDS HAVE CONTINETAL SHELVES;
-- THAT THE AGREEMENT IN ESSENCE EMBODIED THE PRINCIPLES OF THE 1958 [[GENEVA || 5]] CONVENTION ON THE CONTINENTAL SHELF, A KEY FACTOR IN [[GREECE'S ||1]] POSITION ON [[THE CONTINENTAL SHELF ||6]] ISSUE, AND PROVED THEY ARE ACCEPTED BY NON-SIGNATOR STATES ([[ITALY || 3]] DID NOT SIGN THE 1958 CONVENTION).


2. STRONG OPPOSITION WAS SOUNDED BY SEVERAL [[[[PASOK || 9]] DEPUTIES || 10]]. [[THEY|| 10]] AGREED THAT THE AGREEMENT CONSTITUTED A PRECEDENT, BUT WARNED THAT ITS PROVISIONS WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO [[GREECE || 1]] IN FUTURE DEALINGS WITH [[TURKEY || 11]] OVER [[THE AEGEAN || 12]]. [[[[PASOK || 9]] DEPUTIES || 10]] CONTENDED THAT THE AGREEMENT CONTAINED NO DIRECT TIE TO THE [[GENEVA || 5]] CONVENTION. [[THEY|| 10]] STRESSED THAT THERE WAS NEITHER AN EXPLICIT REFERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLE THAT ISLANDS HAVE THEIR OWN CONTINENTAL SHELVES NOR WAS THERE A PROVISION FOR PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST AN OFFENDING PARTY WHICH BROKE THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT. [[THEY|| 10]] ALSO ARGUED THAT THE MEDIAN LINE HAD NOT BEEN STRICTLY APPLIED.


3. [[[[EDA'S ||13]] ELIAS ILIOU ||14]] SPOKE ALONG THE SAME GENERAL LINES AS [[PASOK || 9]] AND JOINED IN VOTING AGAINST RATIFICATION. [[THE ORTHODOX COMMUNIST PARTY || 15]] ABSTAINED, CLAIMING [[IT ||15]], TOO, HAD RESERVATIONS. [[[[THE UDC'S ||16 ]] JOHN ZIGHDIS || 17]] PROCLAIMED THAT [[THE IONIAN SEA || 18]] HELD GREAT PROMISE FOR PETROLEUM EXPLOITATION COMPARED TO [[THE AEGEAN ||12]], AND [[[[HIS || 17 ]]PARTY || 16]] VOTED FOR RATIFICATION, AS DID [[THE RIGHTIST NATIONAL CAMP PARTY ||19]].


4. AS MENTIONED IN OUR EARLIER REPORTING ON THE [[GREEK|| 1]] - [[ITALIAN ||3]] AGREEMENT, [[THE GREEKS ||1]] CAN BE EXPECTED TO CITE IT TO BOLSTER [[THEIR ||1]] LEGAL POSITION REGARDING [[THEIR ||1]]  DIFFERENCES WITH [[TURKEY || 11]] OVER [[THE AEGEAN CONTINENTAL SHELF || 7]] DISPUTE. AS WE UNDERSTAND IT, THE EQUIDISTANT RULE WAS NOT APPLIED ABSOLUTELY IN DEMARCATING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN [[GREECE || 2]] AND [[ITALY || 8]], AND [[GREECE || 1]]  GAVE UP [[ITS || 1]] CLAIM TO SOME OF THE AREA. HOWEVER, [[GOG OFFICIALS || 1]] ARGUE THAT THIS FACT SIMPLY REINFORCES WHAT [[THEY  || 1]] BEEN MAINTAINING ALL ALONG -- THAT [[GREECE || 1]] IS WILLING TO MAKE CONCESSIONS IN PURSUIT OF PEACEFUL AND REASONABLE SOLUTIONS TO [[ITS || 1]] DISAGREEMENTS WITH NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES.
