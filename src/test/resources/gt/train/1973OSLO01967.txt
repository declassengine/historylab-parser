1. [[WE || 1]] ENDORSE THE IDEA OF GIVING A BOOST IN [[THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL || 2]] TO [[THE NORWEGIAN GOVT' S || 3]] MEDIATION OFFER, AS SUGGESTED IN PARA 3 E OF REF A.  [[WE || 1]]  NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT THE OFFER APPEARS TO BE A CONDITIONAL ONE WHICH MAY PROVE TO BE A NON- STARTER SO FAR AS THE [[BRITISH || 4]] ARE CON- CERNED. [[[[OUR || 1]] BRITISH COLLEAGUES || 4]] HERE TELL [[US ||1]] THAT THE DEMARCHE WHICH [[FONMIN VAARVIK || 6]] MADE TO [[THE BRITISH AMB || 4]] ON MAY 22, AND WHICH WAS TO BE REPEATED IN [[LONDON || 5]] BY THE [[NORWEGIAN AMB || 3]]  ON MAY 23, SUGGESTED [[NORWEGIAN|| 3]] WILLINGNESS TO MEDIATE AFTER RPT AFTER THE [[BRITISH ||5]] FRIGATES HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN. THE  [[BRITISH ||5]]  HERE DO NOT, OF COURSE, KNOW HOW [[LONDON ||4 ]] WILL REACT, BUT [[THEY ||5]] ASSUME [[IT||4 ]] WILL REITERATE THAT THE FRIGATES WILL BE WITHDRAWN AS SOON AS [[ICELAND || 7]] AGREES TO STOP HARRASSING [[BRITISH ||5]]  TRAWLERS.




2. AS FOR CALLING UPON A " DISTINGUISHED [[SCANDINAVIAN || 8]] STATES- MAN" AS AN INDIVIDUAL MEDIATOR ( PARA 3 F, REF A),  [[WE || 1]] MAY HAVE OTHER SUGGESTIONS LATER, BUT THE FIRST NAME THAT COMES TO MIND IS [[EDVARD HAMBRO, FORMER [[NORWEGIAN|| 3]]  AMB TO [[THE UN || 10]] || 9]] AND [[EX- PRESIDENT OF [[THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY || 11]] || 9]]. AS AN INTERNATIONAL LAWYER OF SOME REPUTE , LONG ASSOCIATED WITH [[THE WORLD COURT || 12]] AND [[THE PERMANENT COURT OF INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION || 13]], [[HIS ||9]] CREDENTIALS ARE IMPRESSIVE. ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS [[FORMER LONG- TIME [[NORWEGIAN|| 3]]  PRIMIN EINAR GERHARDSEN || 14]]. THOUGH NOT A LAWYER, [[HE|| 14]] IS SKILLED IN POLITICS AND NEGOTIATION AND PRESUMABLY IS FAVORABLY KNOWN TO BOTH GOVTS.
