[[LAW COMMISSION || 8]]


1.[[ LEGAL COMITE || 10 ]] GENERAL DEBATE ON SUBJECT ITEM CONTINUED NOV 6 WITH INTERVENTIONS BY [[GREECE || 1]], [[U.K. || 2]], [[KENYA || 3]], [[BOLIVIA  || 4]], [[LESOTHO || 5]] AND [[ARGENTINA || 6]].


2. [[[[ GREEK || 1 ]] DEL || 7]] ARGUED THAT [[  ILC || 8 ]] STUDY OF STATE RESPON- SIBILITY SHOULD INCLUDE EXAMINATION OF QUESTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION (I.E. CONSEQUENCE) OF STATE RESPON- SIBILITY, SINCE EXAMINATION OF LATTER NECESSARY FOR EFFECTIVE EXAMINATION OF FORMER. [[HE || 7 ]] EXPRESSED APPRECIATION FOR WORK OF [[ ILC || 8]] [[SUB-COMMITTEE || 10]] , UNDER [[ AMBASSADOR || 13 ]]. [[ KEARNEY CHAIRMANSHIP || 13]], IN [[ITS || 13]] EXAMINATION OF NON-NAVIGATIONAL USES OF WATERCOURSES. [[HE || 13]] EXPRESSED DISTRESS THAT [[ILC || 8 ]] ELECTIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY POLITICAL, AND URGED [[ GA || 12]] TO FOLLOW OBJECTIVE CRITERIA.  [[[[ GREEK || 1 ]] DEL || 7]] STRONGLY SUPPORTED [[ILC || 8 ]]  POSITION ON JOINT INSPECTION UNIT QUESTION, AND SAID [[ILC || 8 ]]  SHOULD BE GIVEN AMOUNT OF TIME NECESSARY TO COMPLETE [[ITS || 8]] WORK.


3. IN [[ITS || 11 ]]INTERVENTION (COPY POUCHED L- [[AMBASSADOR KEARNEY || 13]]), [[UK DEL || 11]], SPEAKING ON SUCCESSION OF STATES DRAFT ARTICLES, (A) DOUBTED "CLEAN SLATE" APPROACH ACCURATELY REFLECTED CURRENT STATE PRACTICE; (B) STRONGLY FAVORED INCLUSION OF COMPULSORY DISPUTE SETTLEMENT CLAUSE IN DRAFT; (C) HOPED [[ ICJ || 14]] WOULD BE GIVEN SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SUCH SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES; AND (D) CONSIDERED IT WAS PREMATURE TO DECIDE ON HOLDING A DIPLOMATIC CONFERENCE ON THESE DRAFT ARTICLES AT 29TH GA. ADDITIONALLY,[[UK DEL || 11]] SUBMITTED "WITH MUCH DIFFIDENCE", AND DIPLOMACY, [[ ITS || 11]] VIEWS ON WORKING METHODS OF LEGAL COMITE, PARTICULARLY WITH REFERENCE TO [[ILC || 8 ]] DEBATE. IN ESSENCE, [[UK DEL || 11]] STATED THAT WHILE MANY DETAILED AND LENGHTY INTERVENTIONS WERE OF ASSISTANCE TO [[ LEGAL COMMITTEE || 10]], ON THE WHOLE SUCH ORAL SUBMISSIONS WERE MOST INEFFICIENT, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS (LIKE  [[ILC || 8 ]] DRAFT ARTICLES) WHERE STATES WERE REQUESTED TO SUBMIT WRITTEN VIEWS. [[UK DEL || 11]]  SUGGESTED THAT CHAIR MIGHT SOLICIT WRITTEN VIEWS OF MEMBERS IN SUCH CASES, AND IF THERE WERE NO OBJECTIONS, INCLUDE THEM IN [[COMMITTEE|| 10]] REPORT. [[UK DEL || 11]]  CONCLUDED THAT, AT A TIME WHEN [[ILC || 8 ]] HAS BEEN REQUESTED TO REVIEW [[ ITS || 8 ]]WORKING CONDITIONS, IT SEEMS ONLY APPROPRIATE THAT [[ LEGAL COMMITTEE || 10]]  SHOULD LOOK AT [[ITS || 10]] OWN.


4. WITH RESPECT TO SUCCESSION OF STATES, [[ KENYA || 3 ]] [[DEL || 16 ]] DID NOT AGREE THAT BOUNDARY AGREEMENTS SHOULD BE EXCEPTIONS TO THE "CLEAN-SLATE" RULE. [[HE || 16 ]] STATED THAT A NEW STATE SHOULD NOT HAVE IMPOSED UPON IT RULES WHICH RESTRICT OR LESSEN [[ITS || 3]] PERMANENT SOVEREIGNTY. A NEW STATE MIGHT HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO RENEGOTIATE SUCH AGREEMENTS, BUT NOT TO ACCEPT THEM AS FAITS ACCOMPLI. [[ KENYA || 3]] SUPPORTED 12 WEEK [[ILC || 8 ]]  SESSION.


5. [[LESOTHO DEL || 15 ]] VIEWED [[ILC || 8 ]]   ADAPTATION OF "CLEAN SLATE" APPROACH AS AN INDICATION OF PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL LAW, AND CONSISTENT WITH PRINCIPLE OF SELF-DETERMINATION. ADDITIONALLY, [[ HE || 15]] ARGUED THAT A SUCCESSOR STATE SHOULD NOT BE BOUND BY BOUNDARY ARRANGEMENTS OF PREDECESSORS.  [[LESOTHO DEL || 15 ]] ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO STUDY OF NON-NAVIGATIONAL USES OF WATERCOURSES, WHILE NOTING IT WOULD SERVE NO PURPOSE TO DEVELOP PROVISIONS REGARDING POLLUTION, IF THOSE PROVISIONS RESULTED IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON DEVELOPMENT OF SOME COUNTRIES.


6. [[ARGENTINA DEL || 17]] SUPPORTED 12 WEEK [ILC || 8 ]] SESSION, URGED MFN QUESTION BE STUDIED WITH PRIORITY AND WITH REGARD TO NON-NAVIGATIONAL USES OF WATERCOURSE; THOUGHT [ILC || 8 ]]  SHOULD (A) BASE [[ ITS || 8]] ANALYSIS ON WORK ALREADY DONE IN OTHER FORA SO AS TO AVOID DUPLICATION AND ERROR; (B) GIVE THOUGHT TO FLOOD CONTROL AS WELL AS NAVIGATIONAL USES SINCE LATTER RELEVANT TO STUDY OF NON-NAVIGATIONAL USES; AND (C) NOT TAKE UP POLLUTION STUDY AT THIS STAGE.
