1. SUMMARY: [[[[HUNGARIAN COMMUNIST PARTY || 2]] DAILY NEPSZABADSAG || 3]] CARRIED LONG THREE COLUMN ARTICLE ON DECEMBER 5 ENTITLED "[[AMERICAN || 4]] AND [[IRAN ||5]]". IT IS [[THE PAPER'S || 3]] FIRST DIRECT SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTARY ON THE [[HOSTAGE || 8]] SITUATION IN [[IRAN ||5]]. ARTICLE REFLECTS CONTINUING [[HUNGARIAN || 1]] DESIRE TO FOLLOW [[SOVIET ||7]] LINE CLOSELY, BUT INCLUDES CLEAREST STATEMENT BY [[HUNG- ARIANS || 1]] SO FAR OF SUPPORT FOR DIPLOMATIC CONVENTIONS AND RELEASE OF [[HOSTAGES || 8]]. END SUMMARY


2. [[NEPSZABADSAG || 3]] ARTICLE ON "[[AMERICAN || 4]] AND [[IRAN ||5]]" BY [[FERENC VARNAI || 9]] IS FIRST SUBSTANTIVE COMMENTARY IN [[HUNGARIAN || 10]] MEDIA ON [[IRAN || 6]] SITUATION SINCE [[OUR|| 12]]  LAST PRESS REPORT (REFTEL. MOST PAPERS CONTINUE TO CARRY REASONABLY STRAIGHTFORWARD WIRESERVICE REPORTING ON THE SITUATION IN [[IRAN || 6]] AND THE REACTION IN [[THE U.S.
|| 11]]
3. FIRST PART OF [[VARNAI || 9]] ARTICLE IS LONG RECOLLECTION OF [[AMERICAN || 4]] SUPPORT FOR [[THE SHAH || 13]] AND [[THE MILITARY || 14]], ECONOMIC AND INTELLIGENCE VALUE DERIVED BY [[THE U.S. || 4]] FROM CLOSE TIES WITH [[THE SHAH || 13]]. [[VARNAI || 9]] DES- CRIBES HOW [[THE U.S. GOVERNMENT|| 4]] CAME TO CONSIDER THE REVOLUTION IN [[IRA N ||6]] A SERIOUS FAILURE AND AN ALMOST IRREPLACEABLE LOSS. [[HE|| 9]] STATES THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES IT WAS UNDERSTANDABLE WHEN [[THE TEHRAN LEADERS || 17]] SUSPECTED THAT [[THE SHAH'S || 13]] INVITATION TO [[THE U.S. || 11]] WAS PART OF AN ANTI- [[IRAN || 5]] ACTION. [[HE|| 9]] CITES REPORTS OF DOCUMENTS SEIZED AT [[U.S. EMBASSY || 15]] BY [[IRANIAN STUDENTS || 16]] WHICH SHOWED THAT [[THE U.S. || 4]] PLANNED TO OVERTHROW [[THE ISLAMIC LEADERSHIP || 17]] WHILE [[THE SHAH || 13]] WAS IN [[THE U.S.|| 11]]  [[HE|| 9]] IMPLIES THAT [[BRZEZINSKI || 18]]-[[BAZARGAN || 19]] MEETING IN [[ALGIERS || 20]] WAS PART OF [[CIA|| 21]] PLOTTING.


4. [[VARNAI || 9]] CONTINUES THAT [[WASHINGTON || 4]] CANNOT EXPLAIN THE TURN OF EVENT S IN [[IRAN ||6]] ON THE "EXPORT OF REVOLUTION" BY [[THE SOVIET UNION || 22]] OR ON [[[[IRAN' S || 6 ]] [[TUDEH COMMUNIST PARTY || 23]]. [[HE|| 9]] STATES THAT [[THE LEADERS OF THE IRANIAN REVOLUTION || 17]] ARE FAR FROM [[MARXIST || 24]]-[[LENINIST || 25]] REVOLUTIONAIRES, ALTHOUGH [[THEIR||17]] GOALS IN SEVERAL IMPORTANT RESPECTS MEET THE GOALS HELD BY "OTHER PROGRESSIVE FORCES."


5. IN THE FINAL COLUMN OF ARTICLE [[VARNAI || 9]] NOTES THAT [[THE LEADERS OF T HE [[IRANIAN || 6]] REVOLUTION || 17]] ARE FIGHTING FOR THE INDEPENDENCE OF [[[[THEIR || 17]]  COUNTRY  || 6]] AND FOR THE RIGHTS OF [[THEIR || 17]] POOR PEOPLE. [[HE|| 9]] STATES, HOWEVER, THAT BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF FEUDAL, RELIGIOUS, AND ULTRA-LEFTIST ELE- MENTS, THE REVOLUTIONARY PROCESS FREQUENTLY INCLUDES ELEMENTS WHICH ARE "ALIEN TO [[US || 31]], WHICH ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF PRO- GRESS AND WHICH IN [[OUR || 31]]  VIEW ARE HARMFUL TO THE CAUSE." [[VARNAI || 9]] THEN MENTIONS PARENTHETICALLY THAT DURING THE OCTOBER REVOLUTION [[LENIN ||25]] RESPECTED THE INVIOLABILITY OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS. [[HE|| 9]] ALSO QUOTES [[[[LIBYAN ||27]] LEADER QADDAFI'S || 26]] STATEMENT THAT [[THE HOSTAGES || 8]] OUGHT TO BE RE- LEASED IN ORDER TO WARD OFF THE DANGER OF ATTACK AGAINST THE REVOLU- TION. [[VARNAI || 9]] STATES THAT [[QADDAFI || 26]] IS CORRECT WHEN [[HE || 26]] SAYS THAT RELEAS E OF [[THE HOSTAGES || 8]] WOULD INCREASE INTERNATIONAL SYMPATHY FOR THE [[IRANIAN ||6]] REVOLUTION AND PREVENT IMPERIALISTS FROM USING THE [[HOSTAGE ||8]] AFFAIR AS A PRETEXT FOR LAUNCHING WARFARE AGAINST THE REVOLUTION.


6. [[VARNAI || 9]] CONCLUDES BY STATING THAT [[THE SOVIET UNION || 22]], LIKE OTHER SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, INCLUDING [[HUNGARY || 10]], FOLLOWS A PRINCIPALED POINT O F VIEW. IT:


-- SUPPORTS THE [[IRANIAN  PEOPLE'S || 28]] NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC AND ANTI- IMPERIALIST STRUGGLE; -- AGREES THAT THE INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION OF THE INVIOLABILITY OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND PERSONNEL SHOULD BE OBSERVED;
-- WISHES THAT NO ONE INTERFERE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE [[IRANIAN ||6]] REVOLUTION; AND
-- BELIEVES BOTH THAT [[THE U.S. ||  4]] AND [[IRAN || 5]] SHOULD SETTLE [[THEIR ||29]] DISPUTE THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS AND THAT [[WASHINGTON ||4]] SHOULD REFRAIN FROM UN- CONSIDERED ACTIONS ENDANGERING INTERNATIONAL PEACE.


7. COMMENT: [[VARNAI || 9]] IS EXPERIENCED [[NEPSZABADSAG || 3]] POLITICAL COM- MENTATOR/IDEOLOGUE. [[HIS|| 9]] LONG ARTICLE REFLECTS DESIRE OF [[HUNGARIANS || 10]] TO INCORPORATE AND EXPLAIN VARIOUS CONFLICTING ELEMENTS OF [[HUNGARIAN || 10]] POLICY TOWARD [[IRAN || 5]] WHICH FOLLOWS THE [[SOVIET || 7 ]] LINE CLOSELY. FIRST HALF OF [[VARNAI || 9]] ARTICLE TYPICALLY CONTAINS REPORTS OF [[U.S. || 4]] SETBACKS IN [[IRAN ||6]] AND IN AN OBJECTIONABLE ATTEMPT TO DEMONSTRATE [[U.S. || 4]] PLOTTING AGAINST [[IRAN ||6]]. HOWEVER, [[VARNAI’S || 9]] CAREFUL DIFFERENTIATION OF SUPPORT FOR GOALS OF [[IRANIAN ||6]] REVOLUTION AND METHODS BEING USED BY SO-CALLED STUDENTS IN [[IRAN ||6]], AS WELL AS REFERENCE TO [[LENIS ||25]] ARE MOST EXPLICIT STATEMENTS [[W E ||12]] HAVE SEEN SO FAR BY ANY [[HUNGARIAN || 10]] PUBLICATION ON THE [[HOSTAGE ||8]] ISSUE.
