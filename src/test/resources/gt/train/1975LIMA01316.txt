1. [[AMBASSADOR || 1]] MET WITH [[AIR MINISTER GILARDI || 2]] AS SCHEDULED TODAY (FEBRUARY 14). UNFORTUNATELY, TIME AVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEW WAS SHORTENED SOMEWHAT BY PRIOR MEETING WITH [[FOREIGN MINISTER || 3]], AND [[GILARDI || 2]] HAD TO LEAVE PUNCTUALLY FOR LUNCH WITH [[PRESIDENT VELASCO || 4]]. NEVERTHELESS, [[AMBASSADOR || 1]] WAS ABLE TO PRESENT [[OUR || 8]] CONCERNS ABOUT NEGOTIATING DIFFICULTIES AND POSSIBILITY OF SUSPENSION OF SERVICES.


2. [[GILARDI ||2]] DEFENDED [[MEROPERU || 10]] AND [[[[HIS || 2]] COUNTRY'S || 9]] POSITION. AMONG POINTS [[GILARDI || 2]] MADE WAS THAT [[BRANIFF || 5]] MOVED INTO VACUUM CREATED BY DEMISE OF [[APSA || 6]], AND [[AEROPERU || 7]] IS SIMPLY TRYING TO RECOVER TRAFFIC THAT IS RIGHTFULLY [[PERU'S || 9]]. [[HE || 2]] INDICATED THAT WHAT [[HE || 2]] TERMED  [[BRANIFF’S || 5]]  THREAT TO SUSPEND OPERATIONS IN FACE OF [[AEROPERU'S ||7]] POSITION WAS UNREASONABLY AND HAD ANNOYED [[HIM || 2]]. WHILE  [[BRANIFF || 5]] MAY FIND [[AEROPERU'S ||7]] POSITION UNREASONABLE, [[BRANIFF’S || 5]] INSISTENCE ON AN INCREASE TO 42 FREQUENCIES WAS EQUALLY UNREASONABLE. [[AMBASSADOR || 1]]  POINTED OUT THAT [[BRANIFF || 5]] SIMPLY COULD NOT OPERATE WITH PRESENT PERMIT. [[HE ||2]] ASSUMED THAT PERMIT WAS [[AEROPERU'S ||7]] INITIAL BARGAINING POSITION, JUST AS [[BRANIFF’S || 5]] REQUEST FOR 42 FLIGHTS REPRESENTED WHAT [[THEY ||5]] IDEALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE. SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THESE TWO POINTS THERE MUST BE A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE COMMON GROUND. [[GILARDI ||2]] AGREED WITH PROPOSITION THAT WITH GOOD WILL AND GIVE ON EITHER SIDE, COMPROMISE AGREEMENT SHOULD BE REACHABLE. [[AMBASSADOR || 1]] LEFT WITH [[HIM || 2]] MODIFIED VERSION OF TALKING POINTS GIVEN TO [[PRIME MINISTER ||11]] ON WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 12. [[GILARDI ||2]] INVIDED [[AMBASSADOR || 1]] TO RETURN FOR LONGER SESSION ON THIS AND OTHER SUBJECTS OF MUTUAL CONCER NEXT WEEK.


3. [[GILARDI ||2]] WAS, AS USUAL, MOST CORDIAL, ALTHOUGH [[HE ||2]] DID STIFFEN SOMEWHAT WHEN CIVAIR ISSUE WAS RAISED. WHILE [[WE ||8]] CANNOT DRAW FROM [[GILARDI’S ||2]] RESPONSE ANY GREAT PROMISE OF FORWARD MOVEMENT, AT LEAST [[HE ||2]] DID NOT INDICATE THAT [[PERU'S || 9]] POSITION HAS COMPLETELY CONGEALED.
