[[THEY ||18]] DISCUSSED [[US|| 9]]-[[POLISH ||2]] RELATIONS, IN PARTICULAR FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT QUESTIONS AND AGRICULTURAL CREDITS. END SUMMARY.


2. AFTER OBSERVING THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN [[OUR TWO COUNTRIES || 6]] ARE VERY GOOD, [[THE DEPUTY SECRETARY || 5]] SAID [[HE || 5]] DID NOT HAVE A LONG AGENDA TO ADDRESS IN THE SHORT TIME AVAILABLE BUT DID WANT TO RAISE A COUPLE OF TOPICS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE. [[HE || 5]] ACKNOWLEDGED [[POLAND'S || 2]] CONCERN ABOUT THE QUESTION OF CCC CREDITS AND INDICATED THAT [[UNDER SECRETARY NEWSOM || 7]] WOULD SPEAK TO THIS IN GREATER DETAIL LATER.


3. [[THE DEPUTY SECRETARY || 5]] THEN SAID THERE IS ONE SUBJECT [[HE || 5] WANTED TO EMPHASIZE, NAMELY THE QUESTION OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION. EXPLAINING THAT THIS ISSUE AND THAT OF FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT, GENERALLY, WILL "DEEPLY AFFECT" [[OUR ||6]] BILATERAL RELA I NS, [[THE DEPUTY SECRETARY || 5]] SAID [[HE || 5]] WANTED TO UNDERSC RE THE SUBJECT AS ONE TO WHICH [[HE || 5]] AND [[SECRETARY VANCE || 8]] ATTACH "GREAT IMP RTANCE."


4. RESPONDING, [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] EXPRESSED UNDERSTANDING OF [[U.S. || 9]] CONCERN ON THIS SCORE. THEN, AFTER NOTING THAT THIS IS [[HIS || 1]] THIRD VISIT TO [[THE UNITED STATES || 10]], [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] BRIEFLY OUTLINED THE IMPORTANCE [[POLAND ||2]] ATTACHES TO [[THE JOINT COMMISSION ||4]] AND TO THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH [[THE U.S. ||10]] POINTING TO THE L NG HISTOR OF SUCH COOPERATION, [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] STRESSED THAT THIS COOPERATION HAS PROGRESSED VIGOROUSLY IN THE PAST EW YEARS T THE BENEFIT OF [[BOTH COUNTRIES || 6]]. [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] CONTINUED THAT "NATURALLY" THERE IS AN ACCUMULATION OF PROBLEMS AND THESE WILL BE DISCUSSED AT [[THE COMMISSION ||4]] MEETING, WHICH [[HE || 1]] FELT WOULD PROCEED SUCCESSFULLY. [[HE || 1]] CITED [[POLAND'S ||11]] PROBLEM F CROP SHORTAGES BECAUSE OF [[POLAND'S ||11]] FIFTH YEAR OF BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS. IN THIS CONTEXT, [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] EXPRESSED  [[POLAND'S ||11]] DESIRE TO CONTINUE COOPERATION WITH [[THE U.S. ||10]] AND, ESPECIALLY, TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OSSIBILITIES OF [[US ||10]] CREDITS FOR GRAIN URCHASES.


5. TURNING TO THE QUESTION OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION, [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] SAID THIS IS NOT AN ECONOMIC BUT A POLITICAL PROBLEM WHICH INTERESTS [[THE U.S. ||10]] AND NOTED THAT [[AMBASSADOR SPASOWSKI || 12]] HAD IN ORMED [[HIM || 1]]  OF THE [[AMBASSADOR'S  || 12]] TALK WITH [[ASSISTANT SECRETARY VEST ||13]] THE PREVIOUS DAY (SEPARATE CABLE). [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] THEN SAID [[HE || 1]] COULD STATE UNAMBIGUOUSL THAT [[POLISH AUTHORITIES ||2]] EMPLOY THE MAXIMUM OF G OD WILL IN HANDLING THESE MATTERS. [[HE || 1]] POINTED TO HE "SEVERAL TH USAND" DEPARTURES FROM [[POLAND ||11]] IN THE LAST EW EARS, STRESSING THAT [[THE GOP ||2]] DOES NOT CREATE AN PARTICULAR DIF ICULTIES IN THIS REGARD. [[HE || 1]] ALSO POINTED OUT THAT [[THE GOP ||2]] IS ONLY CONCERNED WITH [[POLISH CI IZENS || 11]], AND IN AN ASIDE ASKED [[AMBASSADOR SPASOWSKI || 12]] TO CONFIRM THAT ONL [[POLISH CITIZENS || 19]] ARE INVOLVED, WHICH [[THE AMBASSAD R || 12]] DID. [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] SAID THERE IS NOT A SINGLE CASE OF AN [[AMERICAN CITIZEN ||10]] NOT BEING SETTLED AND SAID THAT, REGARDING [[POLISH CITIZENS || 19]], [[THE POLISH AUTHORITIES ||2]] ACT IN A DEM CRATIC AND LIBERAL MANNER. CONTINUING, [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] REITERATED [[THE GOP'S ||2]] EFFORT TO EXHIBIT THE MAXIMUM OF GOOD WILL T REACH SOLUTIONS IN EACH CASE. [[HE||1]]  NOTED THAT SOME CASES ARE RESOLVED QUICKLY, BUT SOME- TIMES THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS WHICH REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION BY [[THER GOP ||2]] AGENCIES. [[HE|| 1]]  NOTED THAT [[AMBASSADOR SPASOWSKI || 12]] HAD RECEIVED YESTERDAY FROM [[MR. VEST|| 13]] A LIST OF 10 CASES. NEITHER [[HE|| 1]]  NOR [[THE AMBASSADOR || 12]] COULD SAY ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THEM, BUT THE MATTER WOULD BE ASSED QUICKLY TO [[WARSAW || 2]] FOR A SPEEDY RESOLUTION.


6. [[THE DEPUTY SECRETARY || 5]] SAID [[HE|| 5]] WAS PLEASED AT [[JAGIELSKI’S || 1]] REASSURANCES ON THIS SUBJECT, ADDING THAT SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AND WITH THE AID OF [[[[OUR || 6]]  "TWO FINE AMBASSA- DORS" || 21]] [[WE || 6]] CAN KEEP UP THAT PROGRESS. [[THE DEPUTY SECRETARY || 5]] STRESSED THE "GREAT CONFIDENCE" [[HE ||5]] AND [[THE SECRETARY || 8]] HAVE IN [[AMBASSADOR SCHAUFELE || 20]].


7. OBSERVING THAT [[HE|| 5]] DOES NOT OFTEN HAVE THE CHANCE TO TALK WITH SUCH A [[HIGH [[POLISH || 2]] OFFICIAL || 5]] ,  [[THE DEPUTY SECRETARY || 5]] ASKED [[JAGIELSKI’S || 1]] ASSESSMENT OF [[U.S. || 9]]-[[POLISH || 2]] RELATIONS AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO CONTINUE IMPROVING THEM. [[THE VICE PREMIER || 1]] POINTED OUT THAT A "LEITMOTIF" OF [[FIRST SECRETAR GIEREK'S || 22]] RECENT LETTER TO [[THE PRESIDENT || 14]] WAS [[POLAND'S ||2]] WILLINGNESS TO DEEPEN THE RELATIONSHIP IN EVERY AREA. [[HE ||1]] THEN CITED THE SOUND ECONOMIC BASIS FOR THE RELATIONSHIP AND THE HISTORIC BONDS WHICH LINK [[THE TWO COUNTRIES ||6]].


8. TO [[JAGIELSKI’S || 1]] QUESTION, [[THE DEPUTY SECRETARY || 5]] CHARACTERIZED  [[U.S. || 9]]-[[POLISH || 2]] RELATIONS AS GOOD AND IMPROVING. [[HE ||5]] SAID [[THE PRESIDENT'S || 14]] VISIT TO [[POLAND ||11]] LAST DECEMBER REMINDED [[US || 6 ]] OF HOW MUCH [[WE ||  6]] HAVE IN COMMON. [[HE ||5]] ALSO MENTIONED [[THE DEPARTMENT'S || 16]] RECENT CONFERENCE FOR  [[OVER 200 POLISH AMERICANS || 17]], DESCRIBING IT AS THE FIRST MEETING O THIS KIND AND STRESSING THAT IT REFLECTS THE IMPORTANCE [[WE ||11]] ATTACH TO MINORITIES [[HERE||11]] AND TO THEIR VIEWS AND CON- CERNS IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS. TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT WOULD CONTRIBUTE MOST TOWARD STILL FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS, [[THE DEPUTY SECRETARY ||5]] SAID THAT, BESIDES IMPROVEMENT ON THE HUMAN QUESTIONS SUCH AS DIVIDED FAMILIES, [[HE ||5]] WOULD CITE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF [[OUR || 6]] TRADE AND COMMERCIAL RELATIONS. CONCLUDING, [[HE ||5]] EXPRESSED A HOPE THAT NATURE WOULD LO K MORE KINDLY ON [[POLAND ||11]] IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND THAT THIS WOULD ENABLE [[US || 6]] TO ENGAGE IN A MORE NORMAL PATTERN OF TRADE. CONCURRING IN THIS SENTIMENT, [[JAGIELSKI || 1]] QUIPPED THAT WEATHER PROSPECTS MIGHT INDEED IMPROVE NOW THAT "[[WE ||11]] HAVE A [[POPE || 15]]."
