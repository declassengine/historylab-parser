1. BEGIN SUMMARY. [[MINISTER TO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT AND OF EDUCATION RALLIS || 1]] TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OCTOBER 28 ANNIVERSARY OF [[GREECE'S || 2]] ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR II LAST WEEK TO MAKE SHARP ATTACKS AGAINST THE EXTREME LEFT AND THE EXTREME RIGHT, WHICH HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY CRITICAL RECENTLY OF THE POLICIES OF [[THE [[ CARAMANLIS ||4 ]] GOVERNMENT || 3]]. END SUMMARY.


2. SPEAKING AT THE INAUGURATION OF A STUDENT'S CENTER AT [[KONITSA || 5]], IN [[NORTHERN GREECE || 2]], ON OCTOBER 28 [[MINISTER RALLIS || 1]] CRITICIZED THE [[[[GREEK || 2]] COMMUNISTS || 6]] WHO, IN 1940, [[HE ||1]] SAID, OPPOSED THE WAR AGAINST [[THE AXIS || 9]] (IN VIEW OF THE [[MOLOTOV || 10]]-[[RIBBENTROP || 11]] AGREEMENT).  [[HE ||1]] THEN TURNED TO AND CRITICIZED THOSE ON THE EXTREME RIGHT OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM WHO SUPPORTED THE MILITARY DICTATORSHIP, AND NOW QUESTION THE PATRIOTISM OF  [[THE [[CARAMANLIS ||4 ]] GOVERNMENT || 3]] AND ARE NOSTALGIC FOR [[THE MONARCHI ||8]], ALTHOUGH [[THEY|| 6]] APPLAUDED [[(DICTATOR) PAPADOPOULOS || 7]] WHEN [[HE || 7]] ABOLISHED [[IT ||8]]. THE TEXT OF [[THE MINISTER'S ||1]] SPEECH ON THESE TWO POINTS WAS AS FOLLOWS:


3. BEGIN TEXT. AN ATTEMPT IS BEING MADE BY SOME QUARTERS, AND INDEED OF OPPOSING SIDES, TO FALSIFY HISTORY FOR THE SAKE OF CURRENT PARTISAN OR OTHER, INTERESTS. IT IS, HOWEVER, DIFFICULT TO FALSIFY HISTORY, AND CERTAIN HARSH QUESTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTITUDE OF A SECTION OF THE [[NATION ||2 ]] DURING THE WAR OF 1940, SPECIFICALLY THE EXTREME LEFT,CANNOT BE REPLACED--DESPITE A METHODICAL ATTEMPT TO DO SO. EVERYONE KNOWS, (THAT IS) ALL THOSE WHO FOUGHT ON THE MOUNTAINS OF [[PINDOS || 12 ]] AND [[ALBANIA || 13]], THAT [[THE COMMUNISTS || 6]] DESCRIBED THAT SUPREME STRUGGLE AS AN IMPERIALIST WAR. AND IN [[THEIR || 6]] IDEOLOGICAL CONFUSION AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL OPPORTUNISM, [[THEY || 6]] FOCUSED [[THEIR || 6]] PROPAGANDA ON ([[THEIR || 6]]) ABSTENTION FROM THAT [[NATIONAL ||2]] CALL. YET TODAY, IN SPITE OF THAT TRAGIC ERROR AND OTHERS THAT FOLLOWED IT, [[THEY || 6]] ARE TRYING TO POSE AS CHAMPIONS, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE CHAMPION WAS THE [[NATIONALISTICALLY || 2]] THINKING [[GREEK PEOPLE || 2]]. 


4. SIMILAR CASES OF HYPOCRISY ARE ENCOUNTERED AT THE OTHEREXTREME. THERE ARE WELL-KNOWN INSTANCES OF PERSONS WHO DEVISED ALL SORTS OF WAYS IN ORDER NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WAR EFFORT AND TO SAFEGUARD THEIR OWN SECURITY BY USING VARIOUS HUMILIATING DESCRIPTIONS. IT IS SUFFICIENTLY CHARACTERISTIC THAT SOME OF THOSE ABSENTEES CONTINUE THIS SAME HYPOCRITICAL ATTITUDE TO THIS DAY. THEY SUPPORTED AND APPLAUDED [[THE DICTATORSHIP || 19]] THROUGHOUT THE SEVEN YEARS IT LASTED--A [[REGIME || 19]] THAT HUMILIATED [[GREECE || 2]] INTERNATIONALLY. YET TODAY THEY DISPLAY PREMATURE [[NATIONAL ||2]] SENSITIVITY AND ARE ALLEGEDLY IMBIBED WITH A SPIRIT TO FIGHT. THEY ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO HAD FELT NO HUMILIATION OR ANGUISH WHEN [[PAPADOPOULOS ||7]], YIELDING BEFORE THE [[TURKISH || 14]] ULTIMATUM, ORDERED THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE [[[[GREEK || 3]] DIVISION ||17]] FROM [[CYPRUS || 15]] IN THE DARK, AND LEFT [[THE ISLAND ||15]] EXPOSED. TODAY THEY ACCUSE [[THE GOVERNMENT ||3]] OF LACKING A FIGHTING SPIRIT. THEY ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO SHOWED NO RESENTMENT WHEN [[THE SECOND JUNTA || 19]] , [[THE [[IOANNIDES || 18]] JUNTA || 19]], NOT ONLY BROUGHT ABOUT THE DISASTER OF [[CYPRUS || 15]] BUT ALSO LEFT [[THE ISLAND ||15]] WITHOUT PROTECTION TO FACE [[THE TURKS || 14]].


5. TODAY THEY HAVE THE EFFRONTERY TO QUESTION THE PATRIOTISM OF [[THE [[ CARAMANLIS ||4 ]] GOVERNMENT || 3]] WHICH HAS INHERITED FROM THEM AND THEIR MASTERS ALL THE AWESOME PROBLEMS THAT ARE BURDENING [[HELLENISM || 20]].  THEY ARE ALSO THE VERY PEOPLE WHO EVEN POSE AS NOSTALGIC FOR [[THE ROYAL INSTITUTION ||8]], ALTHOUGH  THEY APPLAUDED [[PAPADOPOULOS ||7]] IN ALL TONES WHEN [[HE ||7]] ABOLISHED [[THE MONARCHY ||8]]. THEY SHOW PREMATURE NATIONAL SENSITIVITY, AND WISH TO APPEAR AS THOUGH NOTHING COULD HLD BACK THEIR WAR SPIRIT. BUT WAR IS TOO SERIOUS A MATTER TO BE ENTRUSTED TO THOSE WHO HAD NOT ENLISTED (IN THE RANKS). [[THE GOVERNMENT ||3]] IS HANDLING [[NATIONAL ||2]] AFFAIRS WITH A SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND CONSISTENCY, AND IS FURTHER DETERMINED NOT TO MISS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SAFEGUARDING PEACE. [[IT||3]] WILL CHOOSE WAR ONLY IF [[IT||3]] BECOMES NECESSARY IN ORDER TO DEFEND VITAL [[NATIONAL ||2]] INTERESTS AND THE HONOR OF [[THE GREEK PEOPLE || 2]].
