2. DURING COURSE OF JUNE 12 CALL BY [[AMBASSADOR || 1]], [[FORMIN || 2]] RAISED QUESTION OF [[NORTH KOREAN || 3]] PARTICIPATION IN THE [[U.S.|| 4]] OPEN TABLE TENNIS TOURNAMENT AND ASKED IF [[THE AMBASSADOR|| 1]] HAD ANY FURTHER WORD FROM [[WASHINGTON|| 5]] ON THAT SUBJECT. [[AMBASSADOR|| 1]] EXPLAINED THAT [[OUR|| 5]] POSITION ON THIS WAS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD. UNDER [[OUR|| 5]] PRESENT POLICY OF UNIVERSALITY IN SPORTS COMPETITION [[WE || 5]] COULD NOT BAR THE [[NORTH KOREAN || 3]] TEAM WITHOUT VIOLATING [[OUR || 5]] OWN PRINCIPLES. [[HE|| 1]] SAID THAT [[HE|| 1]] HAD FOUND NO INCLINATION IN [[WASHINGTON|| 4]] TO CHANGE [[OUR|| 5]] PRESENT POLICY WITH REGARD TO SPORTS COMPETITION. [[HE|| 1]] EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THIS SHOULD PRESENT NO GREAT PROBLEM ALTHOUGH THE TIMING, COINCIDING WITH THE [[ROK|| 7]]/[[U.S.|| 5]] SUMMIT, WS UNFORTUNATE.


3. [[FORMIN || 2]] SAID [[HE|| 2]] UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS A PRIVATE INVI- TATION AND THAT ACCEPTANCE OF THE INVITATION WAS UP TO [[THE NORTH||8]]. HOWEVER, WHETHER OR NOT [[THE DPRK CITIZENS || 3]] TRAVEL TO [[THE U.S.||4]] DEPENDED UPON [[THE U.S. GOVERNMENT||5]]. [[HE|| 2]] REFERRED TO THE RECENT WORLD COMPETITION IN [[PYONGYANG|| 3]] WHERE [[THE ROK||9]] HAD THE DESIRE AND THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A MEMBER STATE. THE REFUSAL OF [[PYONGYANG|| 8]] TO ALLOW [[ROK ||9 ]] PARTICIPATION HAD CREATED VERY BAD FEELINGS INDEED. [[HE|| 2]] POINTED OUT THAT THE [[PYONGYANG|| 3]] MEET WAS INTERNATIONAL IN NATURE AND THUS DIFFERENT FROM THE [[U.S.|| 4]] OPEN. [[HE|| 2]] SAID THAT [[THE ROKG|| 7]] UNDERSTOOD THE [[U.S.|| 5]] POSITION REGARDING INTERNATIONAL SPORTS EVENTS AND THE DIFFICULTY OF PRE- VENTING PARTICIPATION BY SPECIFIC STATES. HOWEVER, [[THE ROKG||7]] WAS CONVINCED THAT IF [[THE USG||5]] FULLY UNDERSTOOD THE [[ROK || 9]] POSITION AND THE TRUE FEELINGS OF [[THE KOREAN PEOPLE || 10]] REGARDING THE FORTHCOMING [[U.S.||4]] OPEN COMPETITION, PARTI- CULARLY IN LIGHT OF ITS JUXTAPOSITION TO THE SUMMIT, [[THE USG ||5]] COULD FIND SOME WAY TO REFUSE ENTRY.


4. [[AMBASSADOR ||1]] SAID [[HE ||1]] WAS NOT AN EXPERT ON VISA QUESTIONS AND THAT MUCH EXPLANATION HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN. THE PROBLEM RESOLVED ITSELF INTO TWO ISSUES. THE FIRST WAS THE VISA QUESTION. FOR YEARS [[THE U.S. || 5]] HAD STRETCHED [[ITS||5]] AUTHORITY TO REFUSE VISAS TO [[NORTH KOREANS || 3]]. THE RESULT WAS THAT THERE HAS BEEN LESS CONTACT WITH [[PYONGYANG ||8 ]] THAN WITH ALMOST ANY GOVERNMENT IN THE WORLD. HOWEVER, SEVERAL YEARS AGO [[OUR ||5]] POLICY WAS ADJUSTED AND PRESENTLY THE ONLY GROUNDS FOR BARRING ENTRY WOULD BE ON THE BASIS OF AN INTENT TO COMMIT POLITICAL ACTS HOSTILE TO [[THE U.S. ||4]] A REFUSAL ON SUCH GROUNDS WOULD BE DIFFICULT WITH RESPECT TO BONA FIDE SPORTS PARTICIPANTS. SECOND WAS THE [[KOREAN || 3]] QUESTION. WHILE [[THE USG ||5]] UNDERSTOOD [[THE ROK||7]] VIEW, IT IS [[OUR||5]]  VIEW THAT THE BEST WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THE NEGATIVE CHARAC- TER OF [[NORTH KOREAN || 8]] POLICY WAS TO PROVIDE A BETTER EXAMPLE. MOST [[AMERICANS|| 4]] BELIEVE THAT [[THE ROK||9]] SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD COMPETITION. HOWEVER, [[WE || 6]] DISAGREE THAT THE PROPER REACTION TO THIS WOULD BE TO BAR [[NORTH KOREAN || 3]] PARTICIPATION IN THE [[U.S.||4]]  OPEN.  [[AMBASSADOR ||1]] SAID [[WE||  6]] DO NOT BELIEVE THIS WILL ATTRACT MUCH ATTENTION IN THE [[U.S.||4 ]] AND URGED THAT [[THE ROKG||7]] NOT INFLATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE.


5. [[FORMIN || 2]] SAID THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY A GAP BETWEEN [[OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS || 11]] IN THE PERCEPTION OF THIS MATTER.  [[AMBASSADOR ||1]] ASSURED THE [[FORMIN || 2]] THAT WE WOULD HANDLE [[NORTH KOREAN || 3]] PAR- TICIPATION, IF IN FACT IT CAME ABOUT, IN A LOW-KEY MANNER.


6. COMMENT: OBVIOUSLY [[THE ROKG||7]] CONTINUES TO BE SERIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT PING PONG. BELIEVE [[OUR||5]] BEST COURSE IS TO CONTINUE WITH A MATTER OF FACT STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE AND A REFUSAL TO BE DRAWN INTO DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE.
