1. [[AMBASSADOR ||1]], IN COURSE OF QUESTION-AND-ANSWER PERIOD FOLLOWING [[HIS||1]] SPEECH ON [[AUSTRALIAN || 2]]-[[AMERICAN ||3]] RELATIONS AT [[AMCHAM ||4]] 13TH ANNULA GENERAL MEETING, [[SYDNEY || 2]], MARCH 29, WAS ASKED ABOUT [[GOA || 2]] "PROTEST" TO [[WASHINGTON || 3]] AND [[MOSCOW || 5]] REGARDING NAVAL BUILD-UP IN [[INDIAN OCEAN || 6]]. [[AMBASSADOR ||1]], RESPONDED BY SAYING: (A) THAT  [[AUSTRALIA || 2]] HAD NOT PROTESTED, BUT RATHER HAD URGED BOTH POWERS TO RESTRAIN THEIR BUILD-UP IN  [[INDIAN OCEAN || 6]]; (B) THAT [[HE || 1]] HAD RECEIVED NO SPECIFIC REACTIONS FROM [[WASHINGTON || 3]]; AND (C) THAT IT IS OF COURSE OUR GLOBAL DESIRE TO NEGOTIATE ARMS LIMITATIONS AND REDUCTION OF FORCES.


2.  [[AMBASSADOR ||1]] TOOK THE OCCASION TO POINT OUT: (A) LIMITED NATURE OF [[OUR || 3]] PLANS TO UPGRADE [[NAVAL || 9]] SUPPORT FACILITIES IN [[DIEGO GARCIA || 7]]; (B) ANY [[FLEET ||9]]  LIKE [[US ||3]] WITH WORLDWIDE RESPONSIBILITIES HAS TO HAVE ADEQUATE COMMUNICATIONS AND RE-SUPPLY FACILTIES; (C) UNLIKE [[USSR ||5]], [[WE ||3]] HAVE NO SUCH FACILITY IN [[THAT AREA ||7]]; (D) [[[[USSR ||5]] NAVAL || 8]] PRESENCE IN [[INDIAN OCEAN || 6]] HAS GROWN IN RECENT YEARS AND IS SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER THAN [[US ||3]] PRESENCE; AND (E) IT IS IN THE COMMON INTEREST TO HAVE AN EQUILIBRIUM OF FORCES WITHOUT WHICH RECIPROCAL REDUCTIONS ARE UNLIKELY.


3. THRUST OF [[AMBASSADOR’S ||1]] REMARKS GOT HEADLINE TREAT- MENT IN THE [[AUSTRALIAN || 10]], FRONT-PAGE COVERAGE IN [[[[CANBERRA || 10]] TIMES || 11]] AND LIMITED COVERAGE ELSEWHERE IN THE PRESS. TV COVERAGE WAS GOOD.


4. COMMENT: [[DIEGO GARCIA || 7]] HAS BEEN GIVEN WIDESPREAD PUBLICITY [[HERE ||10]], WITH A GOOD DEAL OF DISTROTION IN TERMS OF ITS BEING MAJOR NEW BASE THREATENING EQUILIBRIUM IN [[INDIAN OCEAN || 6]], AND INVOLVING [[AUSTRALIAN ||2]] "PROTESTS" TO [[US ||3]]. [[WE || 12]] BELIEVE [[AMBASSADOR’S ||1]] WELL PUBLICIZED RESPONSE WILL HELP PUT ISSUE IN PERSPECTIVE IN WAY LEAST LIKELY TO DEPICT [[OUR ||3]] POSITION AT LOGGERHEADS WITH THAT FO [[GOA || 2]]. ISSUE NEVERTHELESS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO BE CONTROVERSIAL, WITH [[AUSTRALIAN ||10]]  OPINION DIVIDED AND WITH [[GOA || 2]] ATTITUDE ADVERSE YET RESTRAINED.
