1. BEGIN SUMMARY: [[[[ICFTU || 1]] GENERAL SECRETARY OTTO KIRSTEN || 2]] RETURNED FROM [[WASHINGTON || 3]] HIGHLY PLEASED WITH [[HIS|| 2]] MEETING WITH [[PRESIDENT MEANY || 4]] AND OTHER [[AFL-CIO OFFICIALS || 5]] . [[HE|| 2]] SAID THAT [[HE|| 2]] EXPECTED [[JAUERGUI || 6]] TO RESIGN AS [[[[ORIT || 7]] GENERAL SECRETARY ||6]] AS A RESULT OF THE MEETING. THIS WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR A RESUMPTION OF [[THE AFL-CIO || 5]] PER CAPITA TAX PAYMENTS TO [[ORIT || 7]] AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY IN [[KIRSTEN'S || 2]] VIEW, ASSURE THE PRESENCE OF [[THE AFL-CIO ||5]] IN [[THE [[ICFTU'S || 1]] REGIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE || 7]]. SUBSEQUENTLY, HOWEVER, [[ICFTU ASSISTANT GENERAL SECRETARY MAIER || 8]] INFORMED [[US || 17]] THAT [[JAUERGUI || 6]] HAS REFUSED TO RESIGN. END SUMMARY.




2. ON SEPTEMBER 19, [[KIRSTEN || 2]] TOLD THE [[[[MISSION || 17]] LABOR ATTACHE || 18]] AND [[VISITING LABATTS POLLAK AND CONDON || 19]] THAT THE MEETING WITH [[MEANY ||4]], WHICH WAS ORGANIZED BY [[THE AFL-CIO || 5]] FOR THE PURPOSE OF DISCUSSING [[THE ORIT || 7]] PROBLEM, WAS MOST CONSTRUCTIVE. AGREEMENT HAD BEEN REACHED ON RESOLVING HE ISSUE BY ASKING [[JAUERGUI || 6]] TO RESIGN. ([[[[ICFTU || 1]] PRESIDENT DONALD MCDONALD || 12]] WAS ALSO PRESENT AT THE MEETING.) [[KIRSTEN || 2]] SAID THAT [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] FISCAL IRRESPONSIBILITY OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FULLY JUSTIFIED THE SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS BY [[THE AFL-CIO || 5]]. UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE REQUEST FOR [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] RESIGNATION WAS UNAVOIDABLE. [[MEANY ||4]], [[HE|| 2]]  SAID, HAD CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THAT [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] INEFFICIENT PRACTICES COULD NOT BE TOLERATED BY [[THE ICFTU || 1]] OR ANY OTHER RESPONSIBLE UNION ORGANIZATION.




3. [[KIRSTEN || 2]] SAID THAT WHILE [[HE|| 2]] WAS IN WASHINGTON [[HE|| 2]] TELEPHONED [[MEXICO'S || 9]]  [[CTM || 10]] [[GENERAL SECRETARY FIDEL VELASQUEZ || 11]] WHO AGREED THAT [[JAUERGUI || 6]] SHOULD BE ASKED TO RESIGN. [[KIRSTEN || 2]] DID SO, [[HE|| 2]]  SAID, IN ORDER TO AVOID GIVING THE IMPRESSION THAT [[JAUERGUI || 6]] WAS BEING REMOVED SOLELY BY THE "GRINGOS." [[KIRSTEN || 2]] SAID THAT [[JAUERGUI || 6]] MAY BE OFFERED A POSITION WITH [[AIFLO ||5]].




4. ON SEPTEMBER 20, [[HERIBERT MAIER|| 8]] TOLD [[[[MISSION || 17]] LABOR ATTACHE || 18]] THAT AN INCENSED [[JAUERGUI || 6]] HAD REFUSED TO RESIGN AND IS CONTEMPLATING CONVOCATION OF A SPECIAL [[ORIT || 7]] EXECUTIVE BOARD MEETING FOR THE PURPOSE OF COUNTERMANDING THE JOINT [[AFL-CIO || 5]] AND [[ICFTU || 1]]  DECISION. IN A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH [[MAIER ||8]]  (SEE REFTEL) [[JAUERGUI || 6]] BITTERLY ACCUSED [[THE ICFTU || 1]]  OF SUCCUMBING TO [[AFL-CIO || 5]] "FINANCIAL BLACKMAIL."  [[MAIER ||8]] SAID THAT [[HE || 8]] ADVISED [[JAUERGUI || 6]] TO TALK WITH [[FIDEL VELASQUEZ || 11]] BEFORE TAKING ANY ACTION.




5.  [[MAIER ||8]] AGREES WITH [[KIRSTEN || 2]] AND  [[THE AFL-CIO || 5]]  ONTHE NECESSITY OF [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] REMOVAL AS A REQUISITE FOR PUTTING [[THE ORIT HOUSE || 7]] IN ORDER. HOWEVER, [[HE||8]]  FEELS IN RETROSPECT THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION WOULD HAVE BEEN FACILITATED BY PERSONAL DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN [[KIRSTEN || 2]] AND [[VELASQUEZ  ||11]] IN [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] PRESENCE OR PERHAPS BY CONVENING A SPECIAL [[ORIT || 7]] CONGRESS. THE LATTER [[HE ||8]] SAID WOULD HAVE PROVIDED THE ADDED ADVANTAGE OF CHOOSING [[JAUERGUI’S || 6]] SUCCESSOR AFTER DISPENSING WITH THE THORNY PROBLEM OF [[HIS|| 6]] RESIGNATION WITHIN DEMOCRATIC NORMS.




6.  [[MAIER ||8]] SAID THAT [[KIRSTEN || 2]] TALKED WITH [[VELASQUEZ  ||11] BY TELEPHONE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE DECISION WAS MADE ON ASKING FOR [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] RESIGNATION BUT THAT [[JAUERGUI || 6]] WAS ADVISED OF THE DECISION BY  [[[[AFL-CIO || 5]] INTERAMERICAN REPRESENTATIVE ANDREW MCLELLAN || 13]] . THIS APPARENTLY INFURIATED [[JAUERGUI || 6]] WHO HAS MADE NO SECRET OF [[HIS || 6]] DEEP-ROOTED AND HIGHLY PERSONALIZED DIFFERENCES WITH [[MCLELLAN || 13]] SPANNING MANY YEARS.




7. COMMENT:  [[DIRSTEN || 2]] SAID [[THE ORIT || 7]] QUESTION WAS THE ONLY MATTER DISCUSSED AT THE MEETING WITH [[MEANY || 4]] AND THAT [[HE ||2]] WAS GRATIFIED THAT THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON HOW TO RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS HOWEVER THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH [[MEANY || 4]] AND [[[[HIS|| 4]]  AFL-CIO ASSOCIATES || 5]]  WAS IN ITSELF AS SIGNIFICANT TO [[KIRSTEN || 2]] AS THE SETTLEMENT OF [[THE ORIT || 7]]  ISSUE. [[KIRSTEN || 2]] IS A PRAGMATIC TRADE UNION LEADER AND [[HIS|| 2]] APPRECIATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF [[HIS|| 2]] MEETING WITH  [[THE AFL-CIO || 5]]  IS LOGICAL IN REAL POLITICAL TERMS. [[HIS|| 2]] UNDERSTANDING OF [[HIS|| 2]] [[LATIN AMERICAN || 14]] BROTHERS HOWEVER DOES NOT APPEAR PROFOUND AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME MISINTERPRETATION OF THE [[VELASQUEZ || 11]] AGREEMENT ON [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] RESIGNATION SHOULD NOT BE RULED OUT DESPITE [[THE [[MEXICAN || 9]] LEADER'S || 11]] REPORTED DISENCHANTMENT WITH [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] CONDUCT OF  [[ ORIT || 7]]  AFFAIRS.




8. [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] REACTION IN RUFUSING TO RESIGN IS NOT SURPRISING. [[HIS|| 6]]  PRIDE, WHICH IN [[LATIN AMERICAN ||14]] TERMS IS SYNONYMOUS WITH HONOR, HAS BEEN DEALT A SHOCKING BLOW. IN ALL PROBABILITY [[JAUERGUI’S|| 6]] RESENTMENT IS EXACERBATED BY ALMOST CERTAIN REFLECTION ON [[HIS|| 6]] WILLINGNESS THROUGH THE YEARS OFTEN TO DOVETAIL [[ ORIT || 7]] ACTIONS WITH UNPOPULAR  [[AFL-CIO || 5]]  INTERNATIONAL POLICY POSITIONS AFFECTING [[LATIN AMERICA ||14]] . [[ ORIT || 7]] SUPPORT OF [[AFL-CIO || 5]] INITIATIVES IN [[THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC || 15]] IS A CASE IN POINT.
