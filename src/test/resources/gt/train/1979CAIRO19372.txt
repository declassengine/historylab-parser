1. (U) THE FOLLOWING REPORT UPDATES NEWS RELATED TO THE PETROLEUM SECTOR IN [[EGYPT || 1]] CONVEYED REFTELS.


2. (LOU) [[EGPC || 2]] SETS FOURTH QUARTER CRUDE EXPORT PRICE. [[[[THE EGYPTIAN GENERAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (EGPC) || 2]] BOARD OF DIRECTORS || 3]] VOTED SEPT 19 TO SET THE PER BARREL PRICES OF [[EGYPTIAN ||1]] EXPORT CRUDE OIL AS FOLLOWS: [[GULF OF SUEZ || 4]] BLEND, $32.50; [[BELAYIM ||5]] BLEND, $27.50; [[SHOKHAIR ||6]] BLEND, $24.00. THE ONLY CHANGE FROM THIRD QUARTER PRICES WAS A $1.00 PER BARREL INCREASE FOR THE [[BELAYIM ||5]] BLEND. [[EGPC || 2]] SOURCES RE- MARKED THAT [[EGYPT || 1]] IS SIMPLY EMULATING OTHER OIL-EXPORTING COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY SELLING MORE OIL AT HIGHER PRICES, OR RESORTING DIRECTLY TO SPOT MARKET SALES (EG, [[NIGERIA ||7]] ). IN ADDITION, [[EGYPT || 1]] HAS ALREADY CONTRACTED FOR [[ITS|| 1]] ENTIRE OCTOBER EXPORT SUPPLY OF [[SUEZ|| 4]] BLEND CRUDE (235,000 TONS) AT THE $32.50 PRICE. MOST OF NOVEMBER PRODUCTION IS COMMITTED, AND NON-CONTRACT CUSTOMERS ARE REPORTEDLY OFFERING UP TO $35.00 PER BARREL FOR DECEMBER SHIPMENTS.


3. (LOU) [[AMOCO || 8]] STANDS FIRM. [[[[U.S. FIRM|| 10]]  AMOCO || 8]] HAS ONCE AGAIN REJECTED THE $32.50 PRICE, AND [[EGPC || 2]] HAS INFORMED [[THEM|| 8]] THAT [[IT||2]] IS PREPARED TO GO TO ARBITRATION OCT 15. THE [[EGPC || 2]]- [[AMOCO || 8]] DISPUTE HAS HEATED UP IN RECENT WEEKS, AND [[EGPC || 2]] HAS RENEWED [[ITS|| 2]] THREAT TO OPEN UP ALL OF [[AMOCO’S || 8]] CONCESSION AGREEMENTS TO RENOGOTIATION. [[AMOCO || 8]] BELIEVED THAT DIFFER- ENCES WERE SMOOTHED OVER FOLLOWING THE VISIT OF [[[[AMOCO || 8]] VICE PRESIDENT BOSWELL || 11]] IN LATE JUNE, BUT THE PRICE ISSUE, COUPLED WITH [[AMOCO || 8]] FEARS OF POSSIBLE REPRISALS CONNECTED WITH OIL SALES TO [[ISRAEL || 12]], HAS MADE 1979 A TROUBLESOME YEAR FOR [[THE MOST IMPORTANT FOREIGN FIRM IN [[EGYPT || 1]] || 8]].


4. (C) OIL SALES TO [[ISRAEL || 12]]. [[MINISTER OF PETROLEUM HILAL || 13]] IS CURRENTLY HOLDING MEETINGS WITH [[HIS|| 13]] ADVISERS TO DE- TERMINE HOW TO IMPLEMENT [[PRESIDENT SADAT'S || 16]] PROMISE OF SALES OF 2 MILLION TONS OF OIL TO [[ISRAEL || 12]] NEXT YEAR. [[EGPC OFFICIALS|| 2]]  CLAIM THAT [[HILAL || 13]] HAS AGREED THAT [[EGYPT || 1]] CANNOT SELL OIL TO [[ISRAEL || 12]] FOR LESS THAN THE PRICE QUOTED TO OTHER CUSTOMERS. [[ISRAEL || 12]], THEREFORE, CAN EXPECT TO PAY $32.50 PER BARREL FOR [[SUEZ|| 4]] BLEND CRUDE - OR HIGHER - RATHER THAN THE $25.00 OFFERED. (NOTE: [[EMBASSY || 17]] CALCULATES THAT AP- PLICATION OF $32.50 AS OPPOSED TO $25.00 PRICE WOULD COST [[ISRAEL || 12]] AN ADDITIONAL $110 MILLION NEXT YEAR.


5. (C) [[THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM ||15 ]], HOPING TO AVOID THE BLACKLISTING OF [[EGPC || 2]], ASKED [[AMOCO || 8]] TO HANDLE SALES TO [[ISRAEL || 12]] DURING THE PERIOD BEFORE NORMALIZATION. [[AMOCO || 8]] TURNED DOWN THE REQUEST. [[THE MINISTRY  ||15 ]] FURTHER ASKED [[AMOCO || 8]] TO RELINQUISH [[ITS|| 8]] RIGHT TO PURCHASE UP TO 50 PER CENT OF [[EGYPTIAN || 1]] EXPORT CRUDE NEXT YEAR AS STIPULATED IN [[AMOCO’S || 8]] CONCESSION AGREEMENTS. THE [[EGYPTIAN || 9]] REQUEST WAS MADE TO ENSURE THAT [[EGYPT || 1]] COULD FULFILL [[ITS || 1]] COMMITMENT TO SELL 2 MILLION TONS TO [[ISRAEL || 12]]. [[AMOCO || 8]] DECLINED THIS REQUEST AS WELL.


6. (C) COMMENT: [[AMOCO’S || 8]] RIGHT TO PURCHASE UP TO 50 PER CENT OF [[EGYPT’S || 1]] CRUDE FOR EXPORT IS AN OPTION NEVER EXERCISED BY [[AMOCO || 8]] IN THE PAST. [[AMOCO || 8]] MUST DECLARE [[ITS|| 8]] INTENTION TO PURCHASE OR NOT TO PURCHASE THIS ADDI- TIONAL OIL AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR. [[AMOCO’S || 8]] RE- JECTION OF THE [[EGYPTIAN || 9]] REQUEST IS MOST LIKELY MORE A MATTER OF TIMING THAN AN INDICATION [[IT|| 8]] INTENDS TO EXERCISE [[ITS|| 8]]  OPTION NEXT YEAR. [[AMOCO || 8]] NEEDS MORE CHIPS TO TAKE TO THE BARGAINING TABLE WITH [[EGPC || 2]], AND THIS SPECIAL PRO- VISION WRITTEN INTO ALL OF [[AMOCO’S || 8]] CONCESSION AGREE- MENTS COULD BE USEFUL. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE EXISTENCE OF THIS PROVISION IS AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF IRRITATION TO [[EGPC || 2]], AND COULD LEAD TO FURTHER PRESSURES ON [[GOE  OF- FICIALS ||9]] TO DEMAND RENEGOTIATION OF [[AMOCO’S || 8]] CONCESSIONS.


7. (LOU) [[CONOCO|| 18]] INTEREST IN CONCESSION NEAR [[SHARM EL- SHEIKH || 1]]. [[THE [[U.S. || 10]] FIRM CONOCO || 18]] HAS BEGUN TALKS WITH [[EGPC || 2]] ON A POSSIBLE EXPLORATION/PRODUCTION CONCESSION AGREEMENT COVERNING AN AREA EAST AND WEST OF  [[SHARM EL- SHEIKH || 1]]. [[EGPC || 2]] HAS AGREED TO DISCUSS THE AGREEMENT FURTHER, EVEN THOUGH THE AREA TO BE COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE TURN- ED OVER BY [[THE ISRAELIS || 13]] UNTIL 1982. [[CONOCO|| 18]], HOWEVER, HAS NO INTENTION OF DISCUSSING WITH [[THE ISRAELIS || 13]] POSSIBLE WORK BEFORE THE 1982 TRANSFER.
