- COMMUNAL NEGOTIATIONS.



1. (C-ENTIRE TEXT).


2. [[GEORGE SHERRY OF [[THE UN SECRETARIAT ||2 ]] || 1]] SHOWED [[US || 4]] ON MARCH 22 THE TEXT OF A CABLE [[HE|| 1]] HAD RECEIVED FROM [[GALINDO POHL || 5]] SUMMARIZING [[THE [[GREEK || 6]] [[CYPRIOT || 11]] || 8]] NEGATIVE RESPONSE TO [[THE UN'S || 3]] REVISED WORKING DRAFT OF MARCH 14, 1979. [[SHERRY || 1]] ALSO SHOWED  [[US || 4]] THIS WORKING DRAFT BUT DECLINED TO GIVE  [[US || 4]] A COPY OF IT ON THE GROUNDS THAT, WHILE ITS ELEMENTS HAD BEEN DISCUSSED WITH THE PARTIES, IT HAD NOT ACTUALLY BEEN GIVEN TO THEM. ON THE CRITICAL POINTS DEALING WITH [[VAROSHA|| 9]], POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC NORMALIZATION AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FOUR COMMITTEES, THE REVISED WORKING DRAFT OF MARCH 14 CONFORMS PRECISELY TO THE INFORMATION WHICH [[SHERRY || 1]] PROVIDED  [[US || 4]] AS REPORTED IN [[USUN || 4]] 1121.


3. [[[[GOC || 11]] ACTING FM PELEGHIAS ||10]], ON BEHALF OF [[ROLANDIS ||12]] WHO HAD DEPARTED FOR [[HIS||12]]  [[EUROPEAN ||13]] TRIP, TOLD [[GALINDO POHL || 5]] THAT [[THE JOINT NATIONAL COUNCIL ||14 ]] AND [[COUNCIL OF MINISTERS || 15]] ON MARCH 21, HAD DECIDED TO REJECT [[THE UN'S ||3]] REVISED WORKING DRAFT. [[HE||10]]  PROVIDED THREE REASONS FOR THE REJECTION: A) [[DENKTASH'S||16]] JULY 20, 1978 MESSAGE WAS AND STILL IS ENTIRELY UNACCEPTABLE; [[GOC || 11]] INSISTS ON RETAINING THE ANNEX ON  [[VAROSHA|| 9]] CONTAINED IN [[OUR||4]] NOV 10 NON-PAPER AND THE [[THE UN'S ||3]] OWN ORIGINAL WORKING DRAFT. B) [[GOC || 11]] CANNOT ACCEPT A REFERENCE TO NORMALIZATION IN THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FIELDS; AND C) THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FOUR COMMITTEES IS UNACCEPTABLE ON SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL GROUNDS.


4. [[PELAGHIAS||10]] CONTINUED BY STATING THAT [[THE GOC || 11]] BELIEVES THERE MUST BE FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS BUT THAT THESE CANNOT BE HELD WITHOUT A COMMONLY AGREED BASIS. [[HE||10]] FURTHER STATED THAT  [[THE JOINT NATIONAL COUNCIL ||14 ]] AND [[COUNCIL OF MINISTERS || 15]] WILL MEET AGAIN THE EVENING OF MARCH 22 AND THAT IT MAY FORMULATE ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE PRESENTED TO [[THE UN||3]].


5. [[SHERRY ||1]] SAID THAT [[THE UN SECRETARIAT ||2 ]] WOULD MAKE NO DECISION ON WHAT TO DO NEXT UNTIL [[IT||2]] RECEIVES [[GALINDO POHL’S || 5]]  REPORT ON THE OUTCOME OF THIS MEETING. HOWEVER, [[HE||1]] IS INEVITABLY QUITE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT ANY RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH [[GOC || 11]] COMES UP WITH COULD LEAD TO A BREAKTHROUGH FROM THE CURRENT IMPASSE. [[WE||4]] WILL SPEAK WITH [[HIM||1]] TOMORROW FOR FURTHER UPDATE.


6. [[WE || 4]] HAVE JUST RECEIVED [[NICOSIA||17]] 186 AS REGARDS [[AMB. STONE'S || 18]] SUGGESTION REGARDING THE POSSIBLE APPOINTMENT OF A [[UN||3]] MEDIATOR SUCH AS [[URQUHART || 19]] OR [[DECUELLAR||20]].  [[WE || 4]] ARE OF COURSE PREPARED TO DISCUSS THIS SUGGESTION IN MORE DETAIL WITH [[THE DEPARTMENT|| 21]] AND ALSO TO RAISE IT WITH [[THE UN||3]] IF [[THE DEPARTMENT|| 21]] THINKS THIS IS ADVISABLE.  [[WE || 4]]  BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT [[WALDHEIM||22]] AND [[[[HIS ||22]] STAFF || 2]] PROBABLY WOULD BE QUITE RELUCTANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS WAY. AS [[THEY ||2]] HAVE MADE CLEAR ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS [[THEY ||2]] ARE QUITE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE PROSPECTS FOR BRINGING ABOUT A RESUMPTION OF INTERCOMMUNAL NEGOTIATIONS AND HENCE CHARY OF HIGH LEVEL EXPOSURE. MOREOVER, [[THEY ||2]] WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO TAKE A STEP WHICH WOULD SEEM TO UNDERCUT [[GALINDO POHL || 5]] . THERE IS ALSO AN ENDEMIC PROBLEM OF FINDING ANY REPLACEMENT FOR A HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIAL WERE [[HE || 5]] TO BE REQUIRED TO CONDUCT LENGTHY NEGOTIATIONS IN [[CYPRUS||7]]
