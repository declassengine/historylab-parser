1.[[[[ KATHIMERINI || 1]] EDITOR AND PUBLISHER ELENI VLACHOU ||2 ]]  PUBLISHED PERCEPTIVE EDITORIAL SEPTEMBER 22 WHICH LAMENTED HEIRS OF [[[[GREEK || 3]]  POLITICAL LEADERS SOPHICLES VENIZELOS  AND KING PAUL  || 4]] HAD NOT CARRIED FORWARD [[THEIR|| 4]] ATTRIBUTES. [[VENIZELOS|| 5]] WITH [[HIS|| 5]] HIGH INTELLIGENCE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED DEVELOPMENT OF CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO [[1967 MILITARY ||9]] TAKEOVER BUT WOULD HAVE INTERVENED TO PREVENT THE ANIMOSITY WHICH DEVELOPED BETWEEN [[THE GREEK GOVERNMENT ||6 ]] AS LED BY [[GEORGE PAPANDREOU  || 7]] AND THE YOUNG KING. HAD [[KING PAUL  || 8]] LIVED [[THE JUNTA || 9]] WOULD NOT HAVE DARED TO SEIZE POWER.


2. RECALLING [[OTHER NATIONAL LEADERS OF STATURE ||10 ]] SUCH AS [[TSALDARIS, KONDYLIS AND DEMERTZIS || 10]], [[VLACHOU || 2]] NOTED [[THEIR||10]] DEATHS LED UP TO [[[[METAXAS || 11]] DICTATORSHIP || 12]]  IN THE LATE 1930'S. MOVING TO THE CONTEMPORARY SCENE, EDITORIAL UNDERSCORED THAT NO "ORGANIZED" POLITICAL PARTIES EXIST IN [[GREECE || 3]]; ONLY ASSOCIATIONS AND MEN. [[MRS. VLACHOU  || 2]] RECALLED THAT IN [[HER || 2]] YOUTH POLITICAL FORCES WERE DIVIDED BETWEEN THOSE WHO SUPPORTED [[VENIZELOS || 5]] AND THOSE WHO SUPPORTED [[THE MONARCHY  ||13 ]] AND THAT ALMOST NO ONE WAS INTERESTED IN POLITICAL PROGRAMS, POLICIES OR CONFRONTING SOCIAL PROBLEMS.


3. [[MRS. VLACHOU||2]] URGED PRESENT NEED FOR [[GREEKS || 3]]TO REACH MATURITY. "[[CARAMANLIS || 14]] IS AN EXCELLENT NAME AND [[ERE ||15]] A WORTHY VEHICLE. NOTHING MORE IS REQUIRED AT THE POLLS ... FOR [[THE [[GREEK|| 3]] VOTER || 16]] WHO WILL VOTE YO GIVE THE NATIONAL MANDATE TO THE ONE WHO IS RECOGNIZED AS THE LEADER AND THUS ENSURE THE VICTORY OF [[CARAMANLIS || 14]]" EDITORIAL SYMPATHIZED WITH POLITICIANS WHO AGONIZED FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS, AND WHO, NOW CONFRONTED WITH IMMINENT ELECTIONS WITH FOREGONE CONCLUSION, ARE NO LONGER IN HASTE. [[VLACHOU|| 2]] CONCLUDED WITH FRIENDLY ADVICE TO [[OPPOSITION POLITICIANS || 17]] TO PLAY FIRST ROUND BY GRANTING VICTORY TO [[CARAMANLIS || 14]] BECAUSE IN SECOND AND THIRD ROUNDS [[THEY || 17]] CAN ADVANCE [[THEIR || 17]] POSITIONS THROUGH PARTIES OF DIFFERENT POLITICAL TENDENCIES. "LET ALL POLITICAL PARTIES AT SOME FUTURE TIME INFORM [[US || 16]] OF THEIR PURPOSES, PLANS, ALIGNMENTS AND ORIENTATION. IN THIS MANNER THEY WILL ENABLE US WHEN [[WE || 16]] ARE QUERIED WHY [[WE || 16]] VOTE THE WAY [[WE || 16]] DO TO ANSWER SIMPLY "BECAUSE IT IS SO."


4. [[MRS. VLACHOU'S  || 2]] SUMMING UP OF PRESENT POLITICAL MOOD IN RELATION TO [[GREEK  || 3]] HISTORY OF PAST FIFTY YEARS SEEMS ACCURATELY TO REFLECT VIEWS OF NUMBER OF POLITICALLY SOPHISTICATED [[GREEKS  || 3]] ABOUT PROSPECTIVE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS ENVISAGED UNDER LEADERSHIP OF [[CARAMANLIS.|| 14]]. [[HER || 2]] COUNSEL TO [[OPPOSITION POLITICIANS || 17]] TO ACCEPT ELECTION RESULTS AS FOREGONE CONCLUSION, HOWEVER, APPEARS UNLIKELY TO BE HEEDED BROADLY. ALREADY [[[[CU || 18]] MAVERICK JOHN ZIGDIS || 19]], MIRRORING FRUSTRATION OF THOSE NOT INCLUDED ON [[CARAMANLIS || 14]] BANDWAGON, CRITICIZED ELECTORAL LAW FAVORING LARGE PARTIES AND DESCRIBED "NEO-CAESARISM" OF [[[[CARAMANLIS || 14]] ADMINISTRATION || 6]]  IN DECREEING ELECTORAL LAW SERVING [[CARAMANLIS’|| 14]] POLITICAL INTERESTS IN DISREGARD OF INTERESTS OF [[NATION || 3]] AS A WHOLE. [[ZIGDIS || 19]] AGAIN SUGGESTED THAT SINCE NEW ELECTORAL LAW IS "CRIME AGAINST [[NATION || 3]]", [[GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY  || 6]] IS SOLUTION. [[HE ||2]] CONCLUDED "THIS IS OUR DUTY AND WE MUST ACT TODAY SINCE TOMORROW WE SHALL PROBABLY BE FACED WITH IRREVOCABLE FAIT ACCOMPLI." PRESS REPORTED THAT [[ZIGDIS || 19]] SPOKE IN TERMS OF "WE OF CENTER UNION" WHICH MISCONSTRUES REALITY THAT ONLY [[GEORGE MAVROS || 20]] AS [[[[CU || 18]] CHAIRMAN  ||20 ]] SPEAKS AUTHORITATIVELY FOR [[PARTY ||18]] WHILE [[ZIGDIS||19]] HAS SUPPORT FROM ONLY TWO [[CU ||19]] EX-DEPUTIES.
