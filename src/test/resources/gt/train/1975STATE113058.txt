1. [[WHO || 1]] ASSESSED AND BILLED [[U.S.|| 2]] FOR 1974 CONTRIBUTION AT 29.18 PERCENT, OR A GROSS ASSESSMENT OF DOLLARS 34,392,980. THE BILLING ALSO PROVIDED A CREDIT OF DOLLARS 2,663,890 FROM THE TAX EQUALIZATION FUND, MAKING A NET ASSESSMENT OF DOLLARS 31,729,090. [[FURTH || 3]] MAINTAINS THAT IF THE GROSS ASSESSMENT IS RECALCULATED AT 25 PERCENT, THE TAX EQUALIZA- TION FUND CREDIT SHOULD ALSO BE REDUCED.


2. IT IS [[OUR || 4]] VIEW THAT THE TAX EQUALIZATION FUND CREDIT IS NOT SUBJECT TO CHANGE UNLESS THE BILLING IS CHANGED TO REFLECT A [[U.S.|| 2]] ASSESSMENT AT 25 PERCENT.


3. IT SHOULD BE CLEAR THAT [[WE || 4]] ARE NOT RECALCULATING GROSS ASSESSMENT. TRUE, THE AMOUNT [[WE || 2]]  HAVE PAID (DOLLARS 29,466,222, CONSISTING OF THE CREDIT OF DOLLARS 2,663,890 AND DOLLARS 26,802,332 CASH) IS 25 PERCENT OF [[WHO || 1]] TOTAL GROSS ASSESSMENTS FOR 1974 AND IS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT CAN BE PAID NOW IN THE LIGHT OF [[OUR || 2]] APPROPRIATION. HOWEVER, [[WE || 4]] WE RECOGNIZE THAT  [[OUR || 2]] OBLIGATION IS STILL DOLLARS 31,729,090 (29.18 PERCENT) AND THAT [[WE || 2]] STILL OWE DOLLARS 4,926,758.
