AFTER REVIEWING ARTICLE [[HEAP ||5]]  SAID THAT IT WAS STANDARD PRACTICE IN PREPARATORY SESSIONS TO INCLUDE IN EACH PROVISIONAL AGENDA ITEM BRIEF REFERENCE RECOMMEND- ATION FROM WHICH FINAL AGENDA ITEM WILL BE DRAWN. [[HE ||5]]  SAID THAT IN LIGHT OF [[OUR ||8]] QUESTION [[HE||5]] WILL ALTER AGENDA FOR FEBRUARY 15 MEETING SO THAT ITME NO. 3 ACCURATELY REFLECTS WORDING IN VIII-14 PARA 4. IF [[HE ||5]]  IS QUESTIONED ON THIS CHANGE [[HE ||5]]  WILL RESPOND THAT AS GROUP IS NOW AT STAGE WHERE INDIVIDUAL AGENDA PROPOSALS FORSIXTH CONSULTATIVE CAN BE ORMALIZED IT IS APPROPRIATE TO BEGIN TO DO SO.
