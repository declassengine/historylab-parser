1. SPEAKING ON [[HIS || 1]] DEPARTURE FROM [[LUSAKA || 2]] 8 AUGUST, [[[[NIGERIAN|| 3]] COMMISSIONER FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS || 1]] TOLD A [[TIMES OF [[ZAMBIA|| 2]] || 4]] REPORTER THAT HIS [[COUNTRY || 3]] WOULD REACT VERY STRONGLY IF [[THE UK|| 5]] FAILED TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THE PROPOSALS ON [[RHODESIA|| 6]] WHICH CAME OUT OF THE [[COMMONWEALTH|| 7]] CONFERENCE. [[HE|| 1]] ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT [[HE || 1]] FELT [[PRIME MINISTER THATCHER || 8]] WOULD TAKE THE ACTION PROMISED.


2. REFERRING TO THE RECENT NATIONALIZATION OF [[BP||9]] INTERESTS IN [[NIGERIA||10]], [[GENERAL ADEFOPE ||1]] SAID THAT [[[[HIS||1]]  COUNTRY ||10]] BELIEVED IN BACKING UP [[ITS ||10]] WORD WITH ACTION. [[HE ||1]] SAID THAT NEITHER THE [[BP||9]] NATIONALIZATION NOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF CONTRACTS WITH [[BRITISH || 11]] FIRMS HAD CAUSED STRAINED RELATIONS WITH [[THE UK||5]]. [[ADEFOPE ||1]] EMPHASIZED THAT [[NIGERIA||3]] HAD TAKEN THE STRONG ACTION BECAUSE [[IT||3]] FELT THAT HUMAN JUSTICE AND DIGNITY OUT-WEIGHED ECONOMIC INTERESTS.


3. [[THE TIMES || 4]] REPORTER ASKED [[THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS COMMISSIONER|| 1]]  IF THERE WOULD BE A NEED FOR A PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN [[RHODESIA||6]], AND, IF SO, WHETHER [[NIGERIA ||3]] WOULD CONSIDER PARTICPKATING. [[ADEFOPE|| 1]]  RESPONDED ONLY THAT THIS WAS ONE OF THE DETAILS ON WHICH [[THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT ||5]] WOULD HAVE TO WORK.
