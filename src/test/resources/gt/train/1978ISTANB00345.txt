AND OUT OF [[TURKEY || 1]]


BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT SHORTAGE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, [[THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT|| 2]] HAS DRASTICALLY REDUCED FOREIGN EXCHANGE SOLD TO [[TURKS || 3]] TRAVELLING ABROAD. EXCEPTIONS ARE MADE FOR BUSINESSMEN, OFFICIALS, ETC. AS AN INDICATION OF THE EFFECT OF THESE CONTROLS ON AIR TRAFFIC IN AND OUT OF [[TURKEY || 1]], [[[[THE [[AMERICAN || 4 ]] PAN AMERICAN || 5 ]] REPRESENTATIVE IN [[ISTANBUL || 1]] || 6]] TOLD [[ME || 7]] YESTERDAY THAT THE [[PAN AMERICAN || 5 ]]  PASSENGER TRAFFIC OUT OF  [[TURKEY || 1]] IS NOW APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT OF THE NORMAL RATE AND TRAFFIC IN IS 18 PERCENT OF NORMAL TRAFFIC AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. [[HE|| 6]] MENTIONED THAT IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS, EIGHT TOUR GROUPS TO [[THE U.S.  ||4]] OF 30 PEOPLE EACH HAD BEEN CANCELLED BECAUSE OF THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS. AIR FREIGHT, WHICH HAD DEVELOPED INTO A PROFITABLE BUSINESS FOR [[PAN AMERICAN || 5 ]], HAD ALSO DECLINED TO AN ALARMING EXTENT. ALL [[HIS||6]] STAFF WERE NOW ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO STIMULATE BUSINESS; BUT AS [[HE|| 6]] POINTED OUT, IF THE SITUATION DID NOT CHANGE FOR THE BETTER, [[PAN AMERICAN || 5 ]] WOULD HAVE TO CUT FLIGHTS IN AND OUT OF [[TURKEY || 1]], AND PROBABLY REDUCE [[ITS ||5]] STAFF AS WELL. [[HE|| 6]] IS DISCUSSING PROBMEM WITH [[THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT|| 2]] THIS WEEK BUT IS NOT SANGUINE AND NEITHER ARE [[WE || 8]] THAT [[THE GOVERNMENT|| 2]] UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS WOULD ALTER [[THEIR|| 2]] PRESENT RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN TRAVEL.
