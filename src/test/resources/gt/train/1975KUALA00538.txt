1. LOCAL PRESS JAN 28 AND 29 REPORTS FEWER ELECTRICAL OUTAGES ALTHOUGH [[[[NATIONAL ELECTRICITY BOARD (NEB) || 1]] WORKERS' || 2]] PROTESTS CONTINUE IN SOME AREAS. ELEVEN [[[[NEB  ||1]] WORKERS  || 2]] ARRESTED ON CHARGES OF ILLEGAL INDUSTRIAL ACTION (REF A) ARRAIGNED JAN 27 FOR VIOLATION OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ACT; HOWEVER, ARRESTED [[WORKERS  || 2]] DENIED BAIL BY [[MAGISTRATE'S COURT ||3]] BECAUSE [[THEY||2]] ARE "STILL THREAT TO PUBLIC INTEREST." IN RELATED DEVELOPMENT, [[JUSTICE HARUN HASHIM ||4]], [[CHAIRMAN OF [[COMMISSION ON SALARIES AND WORK CONDITIONS FOR STATUTORY BODY EMPLOYEES ||5 ]] || 4]](REF B), SAID JAN 27 THAT "SOME MISUNDERSTANDING" ON PART OF [[[[NEB ||1]] EMPLOYEES||2]] WAS GENERATED BY A "TYPOGRAPHICAL ERROR" IN REPORT MISCLASSIFYING CERTAIN [[WORKERS ||2]] ENTITLED TO HIGHER WAGES BECAUSE OF SENIORITY. ALSO, ON JAN 28 [[NEB GENERAL MANAGER ||1]] ISSUED ULTIMATUM TO STRIKING [[EMPLOYEES ||2]] TO RETURN TO WORK OR FACE DISMISSAL.


2. IN CONVERSATION WITH [[EMBOFF || 6]] JAN 28, [[[[NEB ||1]] CHAIRMAN TAN SRI ABDUL KADIR SHAMSUDDIN || 7]] (WHO IS ALSO [[CHIEF SECRETARY TO [[GOVT || 8]] ||7]], [[THE [[NATION'S || 8]] TOP CIVIL SERVANT || 7]]) SAID THAT TERMS OF [[HARUN || 10]] REPORT ARE NON-NEGOTIABLE AND THAT TO DEAL WITH [[[[NEB ||1]] WORKERS'|| 2]] COMPLAINTS WOULD OPEN UP [[GOVT || 8]] SALARY SYSTEMS TO ENDLESS DEBATE. HOWEVER, [[GOM|| 8]] WILL SHORTLY CREATE COMMISSION TO IRON OUT INCONSISTENCIES AMONG SALARY SCHEMES, I.E., [[HARUN || 10]] SCHEME FOR STATUTORY BODIES, [[SUFFIAN || 11]] SCHEME FOR CIVIL SERVANTS AND [[AZIZ || 12]] SCHEME FOR TEACHERS. [[KADIR SHAMSUDDIN ||7]] ALSO SAID THAT SEVERAL ARRESTED WORKERS WERE EX-LEADERS OF [[[[NEB ||1]] UNION ||9]] WHO WERE PROVOKING DISRUPTIONS FOR "POLITICAL REASONS" AND TO REGAIN CONTROL OF [[UNION || 9]].


3. COMMENT: END TO [[[[NEB ||1]] WORKERS' ||2]] PROTESTS APPEARS TO BE IN SIGHT, NOT IN THE LEAST BECAUSE OF [[GOM'S ||8]] STERN ATTITUDE IN DEALING WITH [[WORKERS' ||2]] GRIEVANCES.
