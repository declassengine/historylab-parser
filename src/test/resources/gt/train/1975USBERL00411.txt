A. [[STATE || 1]] 045432


B. [[CSAF || 2]]/XOO 152048JAN75 (S) (NOTAL)



1. SUMMARY: STATEMENT CONCERNING REDUCTIONS AT [[TEMPELHOF AIRPORT ||3]]  SHOULD BE REVISED BEFORE [[STATE || 1]]/[[DEFENSE  || 4]]MAKE NOTIFICATION TO [[CONGRESS  || 5]] OF WORLD-WIDE [[DOD  || 4]] REDUCTIONS. END SUMMARY.


2. [[MISSION || 6]] HAS COORDINATED WITH APPROPRIATE [[US MILITARY AUTHORITIES || 4]] REGARDING SMALL MANPOWER REDUCTION CONTEM- PLATED AT [[TEMPELHOF CENTRAL AIRPOT (TCA) || 3]].


3. DETAILS OF REDUCTION AT [[TCA || 3]] AS DESCRIBED REF A DO NOT FULLY REFLECT [[OUR || 6]] UNDERSTANDING OF REDUCTIONS ENVISIONED BY [[CSAF || 2]] (REF B). MOREOVER, REF A STATES [[[[BERLIN  ||7 ]] AIR SAFETY CENTER (BASC) || 8]] WILL TAKE OVER PORTION OF FUNCTIONS OF UNIT BEING INACTIVATED. [[BASC || 8]] IS [[QUADRIPARTITE ([[US  || 9]], [[FRENCH || 10]], [[UK || 11]], AND [[SOVIET || 12]]) ORGANIZATION  || 8]] WHOSE FUNCTIONS COULD ONLY BE ALTERED BY AGREEMENT OF FOUR GOVERNMENTS CONCERNED. [[WE  || 6]] ARE NOT AWARE OF, NOR DO [[WE  || 6]] FAVOR, SUCH AUTHORIZATION AT THIS TIME.


4. THEREFORE [[MISSION || 6]] RECOMMENDS PERTINENT PORTION PARA 7 REF A BE REVISED AS FOLLOWS BEFORE IMMINENT NOTIFICATION OF DETAILS OF WORLD-WIDE REDUCTIONS MADE TO [[CONGRESS || 5]]. BEGIN QUOTE AT [[TEMPELHOF CENTRAL AIRPORT (AIR BASE) || 3]], [[BERLIN  || 7]], A SUPPORT ACTIVITY DETACHMENT WILL BE INACTIVATED BY JULY 1975, BUT THE MISSION OF THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED OUT BY EXISTING UNITS. THIS ACTION WILL ALLOW ELIMINATION OF 32 [[[[US  || 9]] MILITARY || 4]] POSITIONS IN FOURTH QUARTER FY 75 AND OF AT LEAST SIX MORE  [[[[US  || 9]] MILITARY || 4]] POSITIONS AFTER COMPLETION OF OFFICE SPACE CONSOLIDATION. END QUOTE (FYI: [[WE || 6]] ARE CONSOLIDATING THE ACTIVITIES OF THIS UNIT WITHIN [[1946TH COMMUNICATIONS SQUADRON  || 13]] AND [[THE 6912TH SECURITY SQUADRON || 14]].)


5. [[MISSION  || 6]] REGARDS THIS REDUCTION OF [[[[US  || 9]] MILITARY FORCES|| 4]] , INVOLVING ONLY [[US SECTOR OF BERLIN || 15]] , AS TOO SMALL TO HAVE POLITICAL REPERCUSSIONS [[HERE || 7]]. CONSEQUENTLY [[WE ||6]] DO NOT INTEND TO TELL [[[[BERLIN || 7]] CITY AUTHORITIES || 16]] OF CHANGE, NOR TO CONSULT WITH [[FRENCH ||10]] AND [[BRITISH ||11]] WITH WHOM [[WE || 9]] SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SECURITY OF [[CITY || 7]].


6. FOR [[BONN ||17]]: SHOULD [[EMBASSY||17]] DISCUSS MATTER WITH [[FRG || 18]] [[WE || 6]] RECOMMEND FOLLOWING LINE: AT [[TEMPELHOF AIRPORT || 3]] A [[USAF DETACHMENT  || 19]]  WILL RESULT IN A PARTIAL WITHDRAWAL OF [[THE UNIT'S || 19]] 57-MAN STRENGTH BUT WILL NOT CAUSE ANY REDUCTION IN [[LOCAL NATIONAL || 7]]  POSITIONS NOR WILL THERE BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OCCUPATION COST BUDGET REQUIREMENTS. THIS REDUCTION IS THE RESULT OF A RECENT [[CONGRESSIONAL ||5]] MANPOWER STUDY. 7 [[WE || 6]] DO NOT INTEND TO ISSUE ANY [[LOCAL || 7]]  PRESS RELEASE.


8. [[USCOB ||20 ]] CONCURS.
