1. [[[[CHROMALLY  ||4 ]] REPS || 5]] [[DONNELLY || 1]] AND [[PEZZANI || 2]] HAVE CONCLUDED TALKS IN [[PEKING || 3]] ON RENEGOTATIONS OF A DOLS 5.5 MILLION CONTRACT SIGNED WITH [[THE [[CHINA || 3]] NATIONAL TEXTILES IMPORT AND EXPORT CORPORATION (CHINATEXT)  || 6]] LAST FALL (REFTEL). THE DISPUTE WAS SETTLED AMICABLY, WITH AN EYE TO KEEPING THE DOOR OPEN TO FUTURE BUSINESS. FROM THE OUTSET, [[CHINATEX  || 6]] APPEARED TO UNDERSTAND THAT [[THE [[US  || 7]] FIRM ||6]] HAD MADE A SUBSTANTIAL ERROR AND DID NOT SEEK TO DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN IN REACHING A SETTLEMENT. FOR [[ITS || 4]] PART, [[CHROMALLOY || 4]] WAS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE GOOD FAITH BY CONCLUDING A SUBSTANTIAL NEW CONTRACT WITH [[CHINATEX || 6]]. AFTER MEETING WITH [[TECHIMPORT || 9]] ON ANOTHER SUBJECT, APRIL 15, [[THE TWO [[CHROMALLOY ||4 ]] NEGOTIATORS || 5]] WERE SCHEDULED TO LEAVE FOR HOME, VIA THE [[CANTON ||3 ]] FAIR, ON APRIL 16.


2. ESSENTIAL DETAILS OF [[CHROMALLOY'S || 4]] FINAL SETTLEMENT ARE AS FOLLOWS:
A) [[CHROMALLOY || 4]] WILL TAKE DELIVERY ON THREE AND ONE-HALF OF [[ITS || 4]] ORIGINAL ORDERS, INVOLVING DOLS 2.2 MILLION WORTH OF GOODS.
B) DELIVERIES WILL BE SPACED OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN ORIGINALLY PLANNED, TO ENABLE [[CHROMALLOY || 4]] TO DISPOSE OF THE GOODS IN AN ORDERLY MANNER WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL LOSS.
C) THE REMAINING EIGHT AND ONE-HALF ORDERS (WORTH DOLS 2.3 MILLION) HAVE BEEN CANCELLED, WITH [[CHROMALLOY || 4]] AGREEING TO PAY COMPENSATION OF DOLS 45,000 (DOLLARS FORTY-FIVE THOUSAND) TO [[CHINATEX || 6]] .
D) SEPARATELY, [[CHROMALLOY || 4]] SIGNED A NEW CONTRACT FOR ONE MILLION COTTON JACKETS. [[PEZZANI || 2]] , WHO PROVIDED THIS INFORMATION OVER THE PHONE DID NOT STATE THE VALUE OF THE NEW ORDER, BUT DID NOT CONTRADICT A [[USLO OFFICER'S || 8]] COMMENT THAT IT WOULD BE WORTH OVER DOLS 1 MILLION.


3. WITH THE RENEGOTIATION SETTLED, [[DONNELLY || 1]] AND [[PEZZANI || 2]] WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT WITH [[TECHIMPORT || 9]] TO DISCUSS PROPOSALS FOR THE EXPORT OF A BALL POINT PEN PLANT AND FELT PEN PLANT TO [[CHINA|| 3]] WHICH HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD BY A [[SWISS ||10]] AFFILIATE OF [[CHROMALLOY || 4]]. THESE TALKS WILL BE CONTINUED THIS SUMMER WHEN [[REPS OF THE [[SWISS ||10]] FIRM || 11]] COME TO [[PEKING || 3]].


4. [[PEZZANI ||2]] PROMISED TO SEND COPIES OF [[HIS||2]]  FINAL REPORT ON THE TRIP TO [[EA/PRCM ||13]] ([[FREEMAN ||12 ]]) AND [[USLO || 8]]  ON [[HIS ||2]] RETURN TO [[THE US || 7]].
