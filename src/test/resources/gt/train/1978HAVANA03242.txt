1. [[USINT OFFICER|| 1]] , OCTOBER 16, CALLED ON [[ACTING VICE-MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE (BETANCOURT ROA) || 2]] TO RESPOND TO [[CUBAN ||3 ]] QUERIES ON FATE OF [[US ||4 ]] DOMESTIC SUGAR LEGISLATION (REF B). [[BETANCOURT || 2]] HAD ALREADY BEEN APPRAISED BY [[CUBAINT [[WASHINGTON  || 6]]  || 5]] OF [[HOUSE || 7]] REJECTION OF CONFERENCE COMMITTEE COMPROMISE.


2. [[BETANCOURT || 2]]  STATED THAT [[CUBA ||3]], IN WAKE OF [[CONGRESSIONAL || 8]] INACTION, WILL NOT DENOUNCE INTERNATIONAL SUGAR AGREEMENT (ISA) NOR TAKE ANY ACTIONS WHICH WOULD PUT ISA IN JEOPARDY. [[HE || 2]] SAID THAT ABANDON- MENT BY PRODUCERS OF EXPORT RESTRAINTS EMBODIED IN ISA WOULD BE SENSELESS SINCE: A) FREE MARKET SUGAR DEMAND THIS YEAR WILL BE FULLY SATISFIED BY AVAILABLE SUPPLY, AND HENCE (B) EXPANSION OF EXPORTS, OR RELEASE OF STOCKS TO MARKET, BY PRODUCERS WOULD ENGENDER POTENTIALLY RUINOUS FALL OF SUGAR PRICES.


3. REACTION OF MAJOR EXPORTERS, [[BETANCOURT || 2]]  SAID, MIGHT BE TO FOLLOW ANTICIPATED LEAD OF [[INDIA || 9]] AT UPCOMING DECEMBER [[INTERNATIONAL SUGAR ORGANIZATION COUNCIL || 10]] MEETING BY DECLINING TO ACCUMULATE FUTHER STOCKS (DUE TO ABSENCE OF FINANCING). [[BETANCOURT || 2]] ALLOWED THAT SUCH A MOVE WOULD HAVE LITTLE PRACTICAL EFFECT, BUT [[HE || 2]]  SAID THAT IT WOULD AT LEAST CONSTITUTE SYMBOLIC RENUNCIATION BY EXPORTING NATIONS OF THEIR ISA OBLIGATIONS IN ABSENCE OF ISA- IMPLEMENTING ACTION BY IMPORTERS (I.E., [[THE US || 4 ]]). BUT,  [[BETANCOURT || 2]]  ADDED,  [[CUBA ||3]] HAS NOT DEFINITIVELY DECIDED [[ITS || 3]] POSTURE ON STOCK ACCUMULATION QUESTION.


4. [[BETANCOURT || 2]]  SAID THAT, WHILE TEMPORARY FAILURE OF [[US|| 4]] TO RATIFY ISA WILL HAVE NEGATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL INFLUENCE ON SUGAR MARKET, DAMAGE WILL BE LIMITED BY: A) ANTICIPATED STABILITY OF [[US|| 6]] DOMESTIC SUGAR PRODUCTION-AND, HENCE, OF IMPORTATIONS INTO [[US|| 4]] AND B) BELIEF OF MANY THAT [[US|| 4]] LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS HAVE CREATED BASIS FOR EXPEDITIOUS PASSAGE OF ACCEPTABLE LEGISLATION AND RATIFICATION OF ISA IN NEXT [[CONGRESS || 8]]. WORST CONSEQUENCE OF [[US|| 4]]  FAILURE TO RATIFY NOW, [[BETANCOURT || 2]]  SAID, WILL BE PROBABLE USE OF [[US|| 4]]  INACTION BY [[EEC ||11]]  TO JUSTIFY [[COMMUNITY ||11]] FOOT-DRAGGING ON ACCOMMODATION TO ISA.


5. COMMENT: IN CONTRAST TO HIS DIRE FORECASTS OF PREVIOUS WEEK ([[HAVANA ||  12]] 3159), [[BETANCOURT || 2]]  WAS REMARKABLY SANGUINE IN FACE OF [[CONGRESSIONAL || 8]] FAILURE TO ENACT SUGAR LEGISLATION AND TO RATIFY ISA. [[CUBANS ||3]] ARE APPARENTLY BUOYED BY NEWS OF PRODUCTION SHORT- FALLS ELSEWHERE AND THUS BELIEVE THAT SUGAR PRICE IS HEADED UPWARD-REGARDLESS OF  [[US|| 4]] INACTION ON ISA. NOTWITHSTANDING [[THEIR ||3]] SEEMING OPTIMISM, [[WE || 17]] FULLY EXPECT  [[CUBANS ||3]] TO JOIN, AND POSSIBLY ENCOURAGE MOVES BY OTHER [[LATIN AMERICAN || 13]] SUGAR PRO- DUCERS TO CRITICIZE  [[US|| 4]]  AT NOVEMBER 13-15 GEPLACEA MEETING IN [[GUATEMALA || 14]] AND AT NOVEMBER [[SELA ||19]] MEETING IN [[MONTEVIDEO || 15]] .  [[BETANCOURT || 2]]  POINTED OUT THAT [[GEPLACEA ||18]] MEETINGS HAVE BEEN HELPFUL FORUM TO "EDUCATE" SMALLER [[LATIN AMERICAN || 13]] SUGAR PRODUCERS AND TO ORCHESTRATE THEIR ACTIONS WITHIN [[INTERNA- TIONAL SUGAR ORGANIZATION || 10]]. THUS, POSSIBLY STORMY  [[GEPLACEA ||18]]  SESSION MAY BE PREVIEW OF DECEMBER MEETING OF [[ISO COUNCIL ||10]] .
