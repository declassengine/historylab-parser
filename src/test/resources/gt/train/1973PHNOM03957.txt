1. THE FOLLOWING IS THE INFORMATION REQUESTED REFTEL:
A. CURRENT AVERAGE RATE PER MT OR PER 40 CUBIC FEET SHIPPED VIA MEKONG FROM [[HONG KONG || 1]], OR [[SINGAPORE ||2]] IS $30-34 DEPENDING ON THE PRODUCT. THESE ARE MINIMUM RATES USUALLY CHARGED FOR TRANS- SHIPMENT ON THROUGH B/ L. RATES FOR SHIPMENTS ORIGINATING IN  [[HONG KONG || 1]], [[SINGAPORE ||2]] OR [[TAIWAN || 3]] ARE SOMETIMES HIGHER AS THEY ARE EKBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF BOTTOMS AND WILLINGNESS OF SHIP OWNERS TO GO. THE RATES FROM [[KOREA || 4]] ARE ABOUT $40 PER MT. IF A CARGO FROM  [[KOREA || 4]] SHOULD BE TRANSSHIPPED IN  [[HONG KONG || 1]] OR [[SINGAPORE ||2]] THE RATE WOULD BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER DUE TO THE ABOVE QUOTED CHARGE FROM  [[KHONG KONG || 1]] AND [[SINGAPORE ||2]] TO [[PHNOM PENH || 5]] ALONE. UNTIL NOW THE TANKERS HAVE NOT INCREASED THEIR RATES FOR POL PRODUCTS FROM [[NHABE || 6]], [[SINGAPORE ||2]] AND [[BANGKOK ||7]] BEYOND THOSE REPORTED AND APPROVED BY[[ MARAD ||8]]. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE TANKER OWNERS ARE PRESENTLY ASKING FOR AN INCREASE IN THE RATES AMOUNTING TO ABOUT 30 PERCENT. THE INCREASE APPEARS TO BE JUSTIFIED. AS PER [[AID/ W' S || 9]] DECISION THEY HAVE BEEN PAID PER CUBIC METER PER VOYAGE. AS LONG AS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE 3 VOYAGES PER MONTH, ON WHICH THE OLD RATES WERE BASED, THEY MANAGED A PROFIT. HOWEVER, IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS, DUE TO THE MILITARY SITUATION ON [[THE MEKONG || 10]], THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE ONLY TWO AND SOMETIMES ONLY ONE VOYAGE PER MONTH AND THEY ARE LOSING MONEY, AS TIMEWISE THEIR VESSELS ARE NOT FULLY UTILIZED.
B. BONUSES AMOUNT TO DOUBLE SALARY WHENEVER SHIP IS ATTACKED RE- GARDLESS OF WHETHER THE VESSEL WAS HIT. THEY ARE PAID BY SHIP OWNERS OR SOMETIMES BY THE CHARTERERS, IF THE VESSEL INVOLVED IS UNDER CHARTER.
C. CONVOYS ARE ORGAINIZED BY [[[[MNK || 11]] CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS || 12]]. PRO- TECTION OF CONVOYS IN [[VIETNAM || 6]] UP TO [[THE KHMER BORDER ||13]] IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF [[[[VIETNAMESE || 15]] MILITARY || 16]].
