2. THE SUBSTANCE OF NEWS REPORTS ON THE [[HAIG|| 2]] TRIP WAS LARGELY FORMAL. FOLLOWING IS THE FULL TEXT OF THE STORY WHICH APPEARED IN TUESDAY EDITIONS OF [[MILLIYET || 4]] AND WHICH IS REPRESENTATIVE OF PRESS COVERAGE SO FAR: HEADLINE: [[SUPREME COMMANDER OF [[NATO ||5 ]] ||2 ]] , [[HAIG||2]], ARRIVED TEXT: [[GENERAL ALEXANDER HAIG ||2]], [[THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF [[NATO ||5 ]] ||2 ]], AND [[MRS HAIG ||  6]], ARRIVED IN [[ANKARA || 1]] YESTERDAY MORNING FOR A COURTESY CALL.

THE RESULTS OF CONSULTATIONS BY [[THE SUPREME COMMANDER OF [[NATO ||  5]] || 2]] ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SHED LIGHT ON THE STUDIES OF [[NATO'S DEFENSE COMMITTEE ||18]] IN [[BRUSSELS || 19]] WITH RESPECT TO [[TURKEY || 1]]. AFTER CALLING ON [[THE DEFENSE MINISTER || 14]], [[GENERAL HAIG || 2]] WENT TO A LUNCH GIVEN IN [[HIS || 2]] HONOR BY [[THE MINISTER || 14]].
