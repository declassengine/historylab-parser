1. SUMMARY. IN [[[[WESTERN || 1]] GROUP || 9]] MEETING FEB 21, QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO SEND EXPERTS TO MDW MEETINGS, COMMENCING MARCH 14, WAS DISCUSSED. SOME BENEFITS WERE SEEN IN FURTHER PRESSING [[USSR || 2]] TO DEMONSTRATE DEFICIENCIES OF [[THEIR|| 2]] PROPOSAL. ONLY [[UK || 3]] PRESENTLY WILL SEND EXPERT ALTHOUGH [[CANADA ||4]] PREPARED DO SO. [[FRG || 5]] AND [[DUTCH || 6]] ATTITUDE WILL DEPEND ON WHAT [[US || 7]] DOES. [[USDEL || 8]] REQUESTS EARLY ADVICE WHETHER [[WE || 7]] WILL PROVIDE AN EXPERT, AND WHAT KIND. END SUMMARY.


2. IN LENGTHY MEETING FEB 21 OF [[[[WESTERN || 1]]  DEL REPS || 9]] (REPORTED SEPTEL) QUESTION WHETHER "EXEPRTS" SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO PARTICIPATE IN UNOFFICIAL MEETINGS OF [[CCD || 10]] ON MASS DESTRUBTION WEAPONS (MDW), WHICH ARE TENTATIVELY AGREED FOR WEEK OF MARCH 14, WAS DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH. [[[[UK || 3]]  REP ALLEN || 11]] NOTED THAT [[[[HIS || 11]] GOVERNMENT || 3]], HAVING ALREADY PROVIDED AN EXPERT FOR LAST SUMMER'S  [[CCD || 10]] MEETINGS ON THIS SUBJECT, COULD NOT AVOID SENDING ANOTHER EXPERT, ALTHOUGH [[HMG || 3]] WAS PRESENTLY UNCERTAIN WHAT KIND OF SO-CCALLED EXPERT SHOULD BE PROVIDED. [[US REP || 19]] STRESSED THAT, ALTHOUGH [[US || 7]]  HAD AGREED WITH [[SOVIETS || 2]] FOR UNOFFICIAL MEETINGS ON MDW IN MARCH 14-18 PERIOD, [[HE || 19]] HAD MADE CLEAR THERE WAS NO COMMITMENT BY [[USG || 7]] TO SEND AN EXPERT, AND THIS QUESTION WAS STILL BEING CONSIDERED IN [[WASHINGTON || 12]].


3. [[FRG AMB || 15]] WHO INDICATED [[[[HIS ||15]] GOVERNMENT  || 5]] WAS CONSIDER- ING SPENDING EXPERT,, AND [[NETHERLANDS AMB || 16]], WHO DID NOT SPECIFICALLY SAY [[THE HAGUE || 6 ]] WAS READY TO DO SO, [[BOTH || 17]] SAID [[THEIR || 17]] [[GOVERNMENTS || 18]] DID NOT WISH REACH FINAL CONCLUSIONS UNTIL [[THEY || 18]] UNDERSTOOD WHETHER [[US || 7]] WOULD OR WOULD NOT SEND AN EXPERT. [[THEY  || 18]] THOUGHT, HOWEVER, THERE WERE SOME BENEFITS IN HAVING COMPETENT EXPERTS, KNOWLEDGEABLE BOTH IN WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT AND IN ITS RELATION TO ARMS CONTROL ISSUES, QUESTION [[USSR || 2]] SEARCHINGLY, SINCE THIS APPROACH HAD LAST SUMMER INDICATED BOTH PROPAGANDA ASPECTS OF [[SOVIET ||2]] MDW PROPOSAL AND LACK OF AN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUALLY-SOLID BASE FOR IT. [[USREP || 19]] AGREED [[HE||19]] WOULD ADVISE OTHER MEMBERS OF [[WESTERN GROUP || 9]] AS SOON AS [[WASHINGTON ||7]] CONCLUDED WHETHER OR NOT TO SEND AN EXPERT TO MDW SESSIONS. (SUBSEQUENT TO MEETING, [[CANADIAN AMB || 4]] SAID [[OTTAWA || 4]] PREPARED SEND EXPERT, BUT AWAITED [[CANADIAN DEL'S || 20]] VIEWS IN LIGHT OTHERS' REACTIONS.)


4. ACTION REQUESTED: [[USDEL || 8]] BELIEVES [[WASHINGTON ||7]] MAY WISH TO CONSIDER ISSUE OF SENDING QUALIFIED [[US || 12 ]] "EXPERT", WITH BACKGROUND CAPABILITIES WHICH [[GERMAN AND NETHERLANDS REPS || 17]] WERE DESCRIBING AS DESIDERATA, FOR PRECISELY REASONS SUGGESTED ABOVE. IN ANY EVZNT, [[WE || 13]] WOULD APPRECIATE ADVICE AS EARLY AS FEASIBLE WHETHER OR NOT [[US ||7]]  WILL SEND AN EXPERT TO MDW MEETINGS, SO THAT [[WESTERN GROUP || 9]] MAY BE ADVISED FOR REASONS SPECIFIED ABOVE.
