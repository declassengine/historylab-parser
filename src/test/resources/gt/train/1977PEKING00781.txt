1. SUMMARY: [[[[USLO || 1]] CONOFF || 2 ]] MET WITH [[MFA CONSULAR DEPARTMENT || 4]] APRIL 20 ON [[CHAO || 5]] CASE. [[CHINESE || 6]] POSITION IS THAT [[CHAO || 5]] IS A [[CHINESE || 7]] CITIZEN AND MUST APPLY FOR EXIT PERMIT UNDER  [[CHINESE || 6]] REGULATIONS. [[USLO || 1]] BELIEVES [[CHAO || 5]] MAY BE GRANTED [[PRC || 6]] PASSPORT AND EXIT PERMIT. END SUMMARY.


2. PROPOSED ACTION: [[USLO || 1]] PLANS TO SEND [[CHAO || 5]] LETTER ALONG STANDARD "PRO-FORMA B-2" LINES AND WAIT ONE MONTH FOR ANY RESPONSE FROM [[CHINESE GOVERNMENT || 6]] OR [[CHAO || 5]] [[HERSELF || 5]] BEFORE RECOMMENDING FURTHER ACTION. SEE ALSO PARA 8 BELOW.


3. [[CONOFF || 2 ]] MET WITH [[[[MFA CONSULAR DEPARTMENT || 4]] DEPUTY DIVISION CHIEF CHEN HUI || 8]] APRIL 20 TO DISCUSS [[CHAO || 5]] CASE. AFTER HEARING [[USLO || 1]] PRESENTATION (REFTEL), [[CHEN|| 8]] GAVE [[MFA'S ||3]] PREPARED POSITION:
--[[CHAO YUN-HUI || 5]] IS A [[CHINESE|| 7]] CITIZEN. [[HER|| 5]] NATIONALITY IS VERY CLEAR. SINCE 1950 [[SHE|| 5]] HAS ENJOYED THE RIGHTS AND MET THE OBLIGATIONS OF A [[CHINESE|| 7]] CITIZEN. THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION ABOUT [[HER|| 5]] CITIZENSHIP. BECAUSE [[SHE|| 5]] IS A [[CHINESE|| 7]] CITIZEN, [[SHE|| 5]] MUST SUBMIT [[HER|| 5]] EXIT APPLICATION TO THE CONCERNED AUTHORITIES [[HERSELF|| 5]]. THIS IS THE GENERAL WAY [[CHINA|| 6]] DEALS WITH EXIT FOR [[CHINESE|| 7]] CITIZENS.
--[[USLO || 1]] DID NOT OBTAIN THE CONCERNED DEPARTMENT'S PERMISSION TO ISSUE [[CHAO || 5]] A PASSPORT. AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT MANY TIMES IN THE PAST, [[USLO || 1]] SHOULD NOT ISSUE PASSPORTS TO [[CHINESE|| 7]] CITIZENS (SIC). [[WE || 9]] HOPE [[USLO || 1]] WILL PAY SERIOUS ATTENTION TO MAKING CERTAIN SUCH CASES DO NOT OCCUR AGAIN, AND WILL RESPECT THE REGULATIONS OF THE CONCERNED DEPARTMENT OF [[THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ||6]].


4. AFTER HEARING [[CHEN'S|| 8]] STATEMENT, [[CONOFF || 2 ]] STATED THAT [[THE USG || 10]] DID NOT QUESTION THE RIGHT OF [[THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT||6]] TO DETERMINE WHO IS AND WHO IS NOT A [[CHINESE|| 7]] CITIZEN UNDER [[CHINESE|| 7]] LAW. SIMILARLY,  [[CONOFF || 2 ]] HOPED [[PRC||6]] WOULD NOT QUESTION [[THE USG'S ||10]] RIGHT TO DETERMINE [[AMERICAN || 11]] CITIZENSHIP UNDER [[AMERICAN || 11]] LAW, AND WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY [[THE USG ||10 ]] WAS COMPELLED TO CONSIDER [[CHAO || 5]] A [[USC || 11]]. THE MUTUALLY IRRECONCILABLE VIEWS OF THE [[PRC || 6]] AND [[USG || 10]] IN THE MATTER OF[[CHAO’S || 5]] CITIZENSHIP, HOWEVER, SHOULD NOT BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO [[HER|| 5]] DESIRE TO RETURN TO [[THE US || 11]]. [[THE TWO GOVERN- MENTS || 12]] , IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE [[SHANGHAI || 7]] COMMUNIQUE, AND WITH A VIEW TOWARDS PROMOTING THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN [[THE CHINESE AND AMERICAN PEOPLE || 13]], SHOULD FACILITATE [[CHAO’S || 5]] TRAVEL TO [[THE US || 11]]. TOWARD THAT END, [[THE USG || 10]] WAS PREPARED TO OFFER [[CHAO || 5]] FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR REPATRIATION AND RESETTLE- MENT, AND WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE VALIDITY OF ANY TRAVEL DOCUMENT THE [[CHINESE GOVERNMENT || 6]] THOUGHT APPROPRIATE FOR [[CHAO || 5]] TO USE IN DEPARTING [[THE PRC || 6]]. SINCE [[CHAO || 5]] HAD STATED [[SHE || 5]] WISHED TO TRAVEL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, [[CONOFF || 2 ]] HOPED [[PRC || 6]] CONCERNED DEPARTMENTS WOULD ASSIST [[HER|| 5]] TO COMPLETE EXIT FORMALITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPROPRIATE [[PRC || 6]] REGULATIONS, SO THAT [[SHE|| 5]] COULD DEPART AT AN EARLY DATE.


5. [[CHEN|| 8]] PARAPHRASED ORIGINAL STATEMENT, AGAIN CHIDING [[USLO || 1]] FOR ISSUING PASSPORT WITHOUT PERMISSION. [[CONOFF || 2 ]] ASKED IF [[CHEN|| 8]] MEANT THAT [[CHINESE ||6]] REGULATIONS PRECLUDED ISSUANCE OF [[US || 11]] PASSPORTS IN [[PRC || 7]] WITHOUT PRIOR [[CHINESE || 6]] PERMISSION. [[CHEN|| 8]] REPEATED THAT IT WAS AGAINST [[PRC || 6]] REGULATIONS TO ISSUE PASSPORTS TO [[CHINESE || 7 ]] CITIZENS WITHOUT PERMISSION, AT WHICH POINT [[CONOFF || 2 ]] STATED THE OBVIOUS: [[USLO || 1]] DOES NOT ISSUE PASSPORTS TO [[CHINESE || 7 ]]  CITIZENS. [[USLO || 1]] ONLY ISSUED PASSPORTS TO AMERICAN CITIZENS. [[CHEN|| 8]] THEN DROPPED THE MATTER, AND EVEN SMILED (NO DOUBT AT THE LINGUISTIC ABSURDITIES ENGENDERED BY [[TWO GOVERNMENTS' || 12]] NON RECOG- NITION OF THE REALITY OF DUAL NATIONALITY).


6. AFTER A HYPOTHETICAL DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEDURES [[CHAO || 5]] SHOULD FOLLOW "IF" [[SHE|| 5]] WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE [[PRC || 7]], DURING WHICH [[CONOFF || 2 ]] REITERATED [[USG'S || 10]]  DESIRE FOR A SPEEDY RESOLUTION TO THE MATTER, AND [[CHEN|| 8]] ONCE AGAIN REPEATED ORIGINAL STATEMENT, MEETING ENDED.


7. COMMENT: DESPITE HARSH WORDS ABOUT [[USLO’S || 1]] ACTIONS, ATMOSPHERICS AT FORTY-MINUTE MEETING WERE GOOD. [[CHEN|| 8]], AN ELDERLY, GRAY-HAIRED LADY WITH A GENTLE MANNER, IS NOT [[THE CONSULAR DEPARTMENT'S ||4]] FIRST-STRING HATCHETMAN WHEN [[USLO || 1]] IS IN LINE FOR A PROTEST, AND MEETING ENDED WITH FRIENDLY WAVES AT [[MFA'S || 3]] MAIN ENTRANCE. THIS, AS WELL AS OTHER INDICA- TIONS AT MEETING, LEAD [[US || 9]] TO BELIEVE THAT [[CHINESE ||6]] MAY BE WILLING TO ALLOW [[CHAO || 5]] TO DEPART [[PRC || 7]] ON [[CHINESE || 7]] PASSPORT. [[CHEN|| 8]], FOR INSTANCE, VOLUNTEERED THE INFORMATION ON PROCEDURES [[CHOA|| 5]] SHOULD FOLLOW TO EXIT [[PRC || 7]]  AS A [[CHINESE || 7 ]] CITIZEN, AND LET [[HERSELF|| 5]] BE ENGAGED IN THE HYPOTHETICAL DISCUSSION NOTED IN PARA 6. THIS WAS NOT DONE IN [[ARCHIE LEE || 14]] AND [[DANIEL KELLY || 15]] CASES. [[CHEN|| 8]] ALSO DID NOT STATE THAT [[MFA ||3]] WOULD ENTERTAIN NO FURTHER REPRESENTATIONS BY [[USLO || 1]] ON [[CHAO’S || 5]] BEHALF, AGAIN A DEPARTURE FROM [[LEE || 14]] AND [[KELLY ||15]] CASES.


8. PROPOSED ACTION: SINCE [[USLO || 1]] HAS NOT YIELDED ON THE QUESTION OF [[CHAO'S|| 5]] [[US || 11]] CITIZENSHIP, NOR, FOR THAT MATTER, BEEN EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED FROM FURTHER CONTACT WITH [[HER|| 5]], [[WE ||9]] PLAN TO WRITE [[HER || 5]] A LETTER TELLING [[HER|| 5]] [[WE ||9]] HAVE DISCUSSED [[HER|| 5]] CASE WITH [[THE MFA ||3]], AND THAT [[MFA'S||3]] ADVICE IS TO APPLY FOR EXIT DOCUMENTATION AS [[PRC || 7]] CITIZEN. LETTER WILL ALSO GUARANTEE AVAILABILITY OF VISA, AS IN STANDARD "PRO-FORMA B-2" LETTER. [[WE ||9]] THEN PROPOSE TO WAIT ONE MONTH TO SEE WHAT DEVELOPS BEFORE RECOMMENDING FURTHER ACTION.


9. REQUEST [[DEPARTMENT'S || 16]] CONCURRENCE IN ACTION PRO- POSED PARA 8.
