1. THE [[SOUTH AFRICAN  ||1 ]] REACTION TO [[THE DCM'S || 2]] DECEMBER 5 PRESENTATON TO [[UNDER SECRETARY BECKER || 3]] OF [[OUR ||4 ]] CONCERNS ABOUT THE [[CHIMOIO ||5 ]] RAID AND ITS DETRIMENTAL AFFECT ON THE PROSPECTS FOR A PEACEFUL [[RHODESIAN || 6]] SETTLEMENT REFLECTS AN ACUTE SENSITIVITY OF [[THE COUNTRY'S LEADERSHIP|| 1]]  FOLLOWING THE EVENTS OF OCTOBER 19. FOR THE RECORD AND POSSIBLE USE IN ANY REPLY OR COMMENT WHICH [[THE DEPARTMENT  || 8]] MAY DECIDE TO MAKE TO THE [[SOUTH AFRICAN || 7]] AIDE MEMOIRE THERE FOLLOWS A FULL ACCOUNT OF HOW THE POINTS ON THE [[CHIMOIO ||5 ]]  RAID WERE PRESENTED TO [[DFA|| 23]].


2. AS NOTED IN [[PRETORIA||7]] 6645, [[WE||4 ]] ACTED ON [[STATE||8 ]] 289251 UPON RECEIPT. [[I || 9]] HANDLED THE APPROACH TO [[HAWKINS || 10]]. IN THE ABSENCE OF [[BOTHA|| 11]] AND [[FOURIE|| 12]] (AT THE [[BOPHUTHATSWANA|| 13]] INDEPENDENCE CEREMONIES) AND [[VAN DALSEN || 14]](ON VACATION) [[I  || 9]] ASKED [[DCM || 2]] TO SEE NEXT IN LINE OF COMMAND: [[JOHN BECKER || 3]], [[UNDER SECRETARY, [[NORTH || 16]] AND [[LATIN AMERICAN || 17]] DIVISION OF [[DFA || 23]] ||  3]].


3. [[DCM || 2]] PREFACED [[HIS|| 2]] ORAL PRESENTATION OF THE POINTS CON- TAINED [[STATE|| 8]] 289251 WITH THREE OBSERVATIONS: (A) GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE AND URGENCY OF THE MATTER, [[HE|| 2]] WAS MAKING THE PRESENTATION TO [[BECKER|| 3]] RATHER THAN AWAIT THE AVAILABILITY OF [[BOTHA||11]] OR [[FOURIE || 12]] SEVERAL DAYS LATER; (B) IN LIGHT OF THE DEGREE OF [[SOUTH AFRICA'S|| 7]] INTEREST IN THE [[RHODESIAN || 6]] PROBLEM, [[WE|| 4]] BELIEVED IT IMPORTANT FOR [[THE SAG || 1]] TO HAVE [[OUR|| 4]] VIEWS; (C) FOLLOWING THE ORAL PRESENTATION, [[BECKER|| 3]] WOULD BE PROVIDED A COPY OF [[OUR || 4]] SPEAKING NOTES FOR [[HIS || 3]] CONVENIENCE. ([[SAG OFFICIALS|| 15]] USUALLY ASK FOR COPY OF REQUEST SLOW RE-READING SO [[THEY|| 15]] CAN TAKE POINTS DOWN VERBATIM. IN ORDER TO ASSURE ACCURACY AND SAVE TIME [[WE ||4]] SOMETIMES INFORMALLY PROVIDE COPY OF SPEAKING NOTES ON BLANK PIECE OF PAPER.) AT NO TIME DID [[THE DCM|| 2]] GIVE [[BECKER|| 3]] TO UNDERSTAND THAT [[HE|| 2]] WAS DELIVERING A "NOTE" TO [[DFA|| 23]].


4. THERE WAS NO SUGGESTION OR IMPLICATION IN [[THE DCM'S || 2]] REMARKS OR IN THE SPEAKING NOTES THAT [[SOUTH AFRICA || 1]] WAS SOMEHOW RESPONSIBLE FOR THE [[CHIMOIO || 5]] RAID. [[THE DCM|| 2]] DID NOT SAY, AS THE [[SOUTH AFRICAN|| 7]] AID MEMOIRE ASSERTS, THAT "[[SOUTH AFRICA || 1]] SUPPLIED [[RHODESIA||6]] WITH THE NECESSARY EQUIP- MENT TO ENABLE [[HER|| 6]] TO LAUNCH SUCH ATTACKS AS THE ONE INTO [[MOZAMBIQUE ||18]]." THIS IS APPARENTLY AN INFERENCE DRAWN BY [[BECKER|| 3]] WHEN [[THE DCM|| 2]] MADE THE POINT CONTAINED IN PARA 3 OF [[STATE||8]] 289251.


5. COMMENT: [[WE || 4]] HAVE MADE SIMILAR APPROACHES TO [[THE SOUTH AFRICANS ||1]] IN THE PAST (E.G., AFTER THE [[MAPAI|| 18]] RAID) WITHOUT DRAWING THIS KIND OF REACTION. [[MY||9]] HUNCH IS THAT [[THEY||1]] DECIDED TO PLAY IT THIS WAY (I.E., AN AIDE MEMOIRE DELIVERED TO [[AMB. SOLE || 19]] TO [[DEPUTY SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER || 20]] MISREPRESENTING THE NATURE OF [[THE DCM’S || 2]] APPROACH) TO UNDERSCORE [[THEIR || 1]] UNHAPPINESS WITH [[OUR || 21]] OVERALL POLICY AND TO INDICATE THAT ON SUCH MATTERS [[WE || 4]] SHOULD GO DIRECTLY TO [[RHODESIANS|| 22]] AS [[I|| 9]] IMAGINE [[HAWKINS||10 ]] TOLD [[HIM|| 3]] [[WE|| 4]] HAD.
