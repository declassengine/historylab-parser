1. WHILE [[WE||1]] HAVE NO INSIGHT INTO [[ROWLANDS' || 2]] SOURCES, I AGREE WITH THEM THAT A TRUE MEDIATION, AS OPPOSED TO ONE INVOLVING THE PRE-AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES, WOULD BE LESS LIKELY TO BE APPROVED BY [[GUATEMALA || 3]]. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THIS WOULD ESPECIALLY BE THE CASE IF, AS PRICE APPEARS TO BE BETTING, THE RESULT OF SUCH A MEDIATION WERE TO BE A FORMULA MORE FAVORABLE TO PRICE THAN THE ONE ON WHICH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN REACHED. MOREOVER, SUCH A MEDIATION PROCESS WOULD INEVITABLY BE MORE TIME-CONSUMING, INCREASING THE LIKELI- HOOD THAT THE ISSUE WOULD NOT BE RESOLVED DURING [[PRESIDENT LAUGERUD'S ADMINISTRATION || 4]]. AS OTHER MESSAGES IN THIS SERIES HAVE INDICATED, [[WE||1]] BELIEVE THAT CURRENT MOMENTUM WILL PROBABLY BE LOST IF THE ISSUE IS ALLOWED TO PASS [[LAUGERUD'S ||4]] SUCCESSOR, WHOEVER HE PROVES TO BE. IT HAS BEEN [[OUR||1]] JUDGMENT THAT NEITHER [[LUCAS || 5]] NOR [[PERALTA AZURDIA || 6]] SEEM AS WELL-DISPOSED AS [[LAUGERUD ||4]] TO BLESS A SETTLEMENT RELINQUISHING THE BULK OF [[GUATEMALA'S ||7]] HISTORICAL CLAIM, WHILE [[PERALTA MENDEZ ||8]], WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE BE MORE AMENABLE, WOULD PROBABLY NOT ENJOY THE POLITICAL FREEDOM OF ACTION ENABLING [[HIM||8]] TO RUN THAT RISK. WM [[I || 11]] ALSO HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE DESIRABILITY -- FROM THE STANDPOINT OF [[OUR || 1]] OWN INTERESTS -- OF CONDUCTING THE MEDIATION UNDER THE EXPLICIT AEGIS OF [[THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ||9]]. AT BEST, THIS WOULD EXPOSE [[US||9]] TO RECRIMINATION IN BOTH [[GUATEMALA || 7]] AND [[BELIZE || 10]] BY THOSE ELEMENTS WHO WILL SEE THE SETTLEMENT AS A BETRAYAL OF THEIR NATIONAL INTEREST. WHATEVER FORM OF MEDIATION IS DECIDED UPON, IT WOULD BE MORE PRUDENT FOR [[US || 1]], IN [[MY || 11]] VIEW, FOR THE PARTIES TO SELECT A MEDIATOR INDEPEN- DENTLY, ALBEIT WITH [[OUR|| 1]] INFORMAL GOOD OFFICES. 


3.[[ I ||11]] AM SOMEWHAT CONCERNED, IN SUM, THAT THE POSITION WHICH APPEARS TO BE EMERGING BETWEEN [[THE BRITISH || 12]] AND [[PRICE ||13 ]] MAY FALL ENOUGH SHORT OF [[GUATEMALAN || 3]] REQUIREMENTS AS TO THREATEN THE SUCCESS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS, ESPECIALLY AS THE TIME TO COMPLETE THE ARRANGEMENTS IS GETTING SHORT. [[I ||11]] NOT ONLY BELIEVE THAT [[PRESIDENT LAUGERUD || 4]] MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH THE CONCEPT OF A TRUE MEDIATION BUT THAT [[HE || 4]] WILL BE SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN [[HE ||4 ]] LEARNS THAT [[THE BRITISH  ||12 ]] ARE NO CLOSER TO MEETING [[HIS  || 4]] REQUEST FOR A ROAD PROJECT IN [[GUATEMALA  || 7]] THAN APPEARS TO BE THE CASE FROM [[ROWLANDS'  ||2 ]] PRESENTATION TO THE [[SECRETARY || 14]]. AS OF THE LAST ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS, AT LEAST, THIS WAS THE MAIN STICKING POINT ON [[THE GUATEMALAN SIDE  || 3]] AFTER [[THEY  ||3 ]] HAD MADE WHAT [[THEY  ||3 ]] CONSIDERED TO BE A CAPITAL SACRIFICE ON THE ISSUE OF TERRITORY. 4. [[DEPARTMENT  || 15]] PASS AS DESIRED.
