PLEASE CONVEY SOONEST FOLLOWING TEXT OF LETTER FROM [[ASSISTANT SECRETARY HATHAWAY || 1]] TO [[VICE MINISTER GORDEEV || 2]]. 


BEGIN TEXT: AS [[YOU || 2]] ARE WELL AWARE FROM  [[OUR || 13]] PREVIOUS TWO MEETINGS, [[MY || 1]] [[GOVERNMENT|| 3]] ATTACHES SPECIAL IMPORTANCE TO THE TRADE WHICH HAS EVOLVED IN GRAINS BETWEEN [[OUR TWO COUNTRIES || 13]] AND TO THE SMOOTH OPERATION OF [[OUR || 13]] CURRENT FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT CONCERNING TRADE IN WHEAT AND CORN IN PARTICULAR. WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT [[WE || 13 ]] SHALL AGAIN BE MEETING NEXT MAY FOR REGULAR CONSULTATIONS IN CONNEC- TION WITH THE GRAINS AGREEMENT, THERE HAVE BEEN DEVELOP- MENTS SINCE [[OUR || 13]]  OCTOBER MEETING, WHICH [[ I || 1]] FEEL MAKE IT IMPORTANT THAT  [[WE || 13 ]]  HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSULTATIONS AT AN EARLIER DATE.


IN [[OUR || 13]]  PAST MEETINGS,  [[WE || 13 ]]  HAVE, [[ I || 1]]  BELIEVE, REITERATED  [[OUR || 13]] MUTUAL INTERESTS IN THE SO-CALLED "EVEN SPACING" PROVISION, AND IT SEEMS THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO QUESTION OF CONTINUED SYMPATHY FROM [[BOTH SIDES || 13]] AS TO BOTH THE SPIRIT AND BROAD INTENT OF THAT PROVISION. AT THE SAME TIME, THOUGH [[OUR || 13]]  PAST DISCUSSIONS HAVE NOT DEALT EXTEN- SIVELY WITH THE MATTER, I BELIEVE  [[WE || 13 ]]  HAVE BOTH RECOGNIZED THAT, FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF PRACTICAL OPERATIONS, A CERTAIN ELEMENT OF FLEXIBILITY SHOULD BE ATTACHED TO THIS PROVISION. IT IS THEREFORE UNDERSTANDABLE THAT FROM TIME TO TIME  [[WE || 13 ]]  MAY NEED TO COMMUNICATE FURTHER IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE FULLEST MEASURE OF CONTINUED UNDERSTANDING DURING THE INTERVALS BETWEEN REGULAR CONSULTATIONS.


[[ I || 1]]  BELIEVE THAT  [[WE || 13 ]]  SHOULD DISCUSS POSSIBLE PROCEDURES WHEREBY WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD [[BOTH SIDES ||  13]] WOULD BE ADVISED AS TO THE AGGREGATE QUANTITY OF ARRANGEMENTS ALREADY ENTERED INTO THAT HAVE NOT AS YET, BUT MIGHT EVENTUALLY, RESULT IN CONTRACTS WITH [[U.S. || 4]] EXPORT ENTITIES FOR THE EXPORT OF [[U.S. || 4]] GRAIN.


A FURTHER POINT TO BE ADDRESSED IN AN INTERIM MEETING CONCERNS THE RELATED MATTER OF OVERALL [[SOVIET || 5]] IMPORT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 1977/78 SEASON, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE 1977 [[SOVIET || 5]] GRAIN CROP OUTTURN WAS BELOW PLAN LEVEL. [[ I || 1]]  REALIZE THAT INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF [[OUR || 13]]  OCTOBER MEETING TO PERMIT A MORE EXTENDED DISCUS- SION OF THE MATTER OF OVERALL IMPORT REQUIREMENTS AT THAT TIME. BUT WITH THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION NOW AVAILABLE FOR PLANNING PURPOSES WITHIN [[THE SOVIET UNION|| 5]], IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS POINT. THE FULLEST POSSIBLE UNDER- STANDING BETWEEN [[US|| 13]] IN THIS AREA IS, AS [[ I || 1]]  AM SURE [[YOU || 2]] WILL UNDERSTAND, VERY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY IN FACILI- TATING OPERATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 6 OF THE AGREEMENT. AS [[YOU || 2]]  ARE AWARE, [[ I || 1]]  SHALL BE VISITING [[MOSCOW|| 5]] NEXT MONTH FOR MEETINGS WHICH CONCERN THE AGREEMENT ON AGRICULTURAL COOPERATION. [[ I || 1]] WOULD LIKE TO MEET WITH [[YOU || 2]] AT THAT TIME TO FURTHER DISCUSS THE MATTERS RAISED IN THIS LETTER. THE DATE MOST SUITABLE FOR [[ME || 1]] WOULD BE DECEMBER 14. IF SUCH MEETING WERE TO BE ARRANGED, [[ I || 1]] WOULD PLAN TO BRING WITH ME [[MR. SAYLOR || 8]], [[MR. NOVOTNY || 9]], [[MR. PENCE || 10]] OF [[USDA || 7]], [[MR. EDGAR OF THE [[DEPARTMENT OF STATE|| 6]] || 11]], AND [[MR. TRICK || 12]]. PLEASE LET [[ME || 1]] KNOW AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE WHETHER A MEETING ON DECEMBER 14 COULD BE ARRANGED. END TEXT.
