1. [[PRESIDENT ZIA || 1]] WAS MOST GRATEFUL FOR [[THE PRESIDENT'S || 2]]  WARM LETTER AND SHOWED NO VISIBLE SIGN OF DISAPPOINTMENT AT NOT BEING INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE THIS FALL. SINCE [[ZIA || 1]] WAS LEAVING FOR [[NORTH KOREA  || 3]]  ON THE EARLY MORNING OF SEPT. 8, [[I  || 5]] HAD TOLD [[HIS || 1]] OFFICE [[I || 5 ]]  COULD EITHER SEND AROUND THE LETTER IMMEDIATELY OR DELIVER IT PERSONALLY THAT DAY, THE 7TH. [[THE PRESIDENT || 1]]  INVITED [[ME || 5]]  TO CALL AT 8PM AT [[HIS || 1]]  RESIDENCE IN THE CANTONMENT, WHERE [[HE || 1]]  MET [[ME || 5]] WITH [[FOREIGN MINISTER SHAMSUL HUQ || 4]]. [[ZIA || 1]] READ AND RE-READ THE LETTER WITH GREAT CARE AT THE BEGINNING OF [[MY || 5]] CALL AND FROM [[HIS || 1]] REACTION IT WAS APPARENT THAT [[HE || 1]] ALREADY KNEW [[HE || 1]] COULD NOT BE INVITED TO [[WASHINGTON ||6]]. [[HE || 1]] IMMEDIATELY SMILED AND SAID IT WAS A GOOD LETTER AND LISTENED TO [[ME || 5]] DESCRIBE INGREATER DETAIL THE HEAVY BURDENS WHICH PREVENTED [[PRESIDENT CARTER || 2]] FROM RECEIVING [[HIM|| 1]] DURING A VISIT TO [[THE UN || 7]] .  [[ZIA || 1]] SAID [[HE || 1]] UNDERSTOOD AND, ALTHOUGH I KNOW [[HE || 1]] IS GREATLY DISAPPOINTED, [[I || 5]] BELIEVE [[HE || 1]] DOES ACCEPT THE VALIDITY OF THE REASONS. AS THE ATMOSPHERE WAS AN EASY ONE, [[I || 5]] ASKED THE PRESIDENT IF [[HE|| 1]] HAD TIME TO DISCUSS OTHER MATTERS AND THERE ENSUED AN HOUR-LONG CONVERSATION, PARTS OF WHICH [[I || 5]] AM REPORTING SEPARATELY. AT THE END OF OUR TALK,  [[ZIA || 1]] AGAIN REFERRED TO [[THE PRESIDENT'S || 2]] LETTER; IT WAS A "BEAUTIFUL LETTER" [[HE || 1]] SAID. IT WAS "WARM, SINCERE, CORDIAL, UNDERSTANDING..." AND [[HE || 1]] CONTINUED TO ADD SIMILAR ADJECTIVES. [[HE || 1]] ASKED PART- ICULARLY THAT [[I ||5]] CONVEY TO [[THE PRESIDENT||2]] [[HIS || 1]] GREAT APPRECIATION FOR THE LETTER AND INFORM [[HIM ||2]] THAT [[HE|| 1]] WOULD REPLY TO IT SOON.


2. [[ I || 5]] CONCLUDE THAT THE LETTER HAS SERVED ITS PURPOSE ADMIRABLY. [[THE PRESIDENT || 2]] HAS CAUSED  [[ZIA || 1]] TO UNDERSTAND THAT ALTHOUGH [[THE PRESIDENT || 2]] CANNOT RECEIVE [[HIM ||1]] IN [[WASHINGTON ||6]], [[WE || 9]] RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT [[HE || 1]] IS DOING IN [[BANGLADESH ||8]]. [[ I || 5]] BELIEVE THIS ENCOURAGEMENT HAS BEEN APPROPRIATE AS [[WE || 9]] ARE ONE OF THE FACTORS WHICH IS INFLUENCING  [[ZIA || 1]] TO PROCEED ALONG THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DIRECTIONS [[HE || 1]] HAS CHOSEN. THE LETTER SHOULD SERVE THIS PURPOSE WELL UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR WHEN, IF EVENTS CONTINUE TO PROCEED SMOOTHLY [[HERE || 8]] , [[ I || 5]] HOPE THE ISSUANCE OF AN INVITATION TO VISIT [[THE US ||6]] MAY BECOME PRACTICABLE.
