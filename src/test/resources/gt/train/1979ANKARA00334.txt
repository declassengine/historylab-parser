1. CONFIDENTIAL ENTIRE TEXT.


2. SUMMARY: DURING THREE AND ONE-HALF HOUR CONVERSATION MORNING JANUARY 11, [[DEPUTY SECRETARY CHRISTOPHER || 1]] DISCUSSED STATUS OF [[SECRETARY GENERAL WALDHEIM'S || 2]] EFFORTS TO RESUME [[CYPRUS || 3]] INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS. [[FOREIGN MINISTER OKCUN || 4]] AND [[SECRETARY GENERAL ELEKDAG || 5]] WERE ALSO PRESENT. [[ECEVIT || 6]] STRESSED THAT [[VAROSHA || 7]] PARAGRAPH IN JANUARY 9 [[DENKTASH || 8]] RESPONSE WAS NOT INTENDED REPRESENT CHANGE FROM JULY [[DENKTASH || 8]] PROPOSAL ON [[VAROSHA || 7]].  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  ALSO STRESSED THAT ECONOMIC BLOCKADE PARAGRAPH WAS INTENDED TO BE AGENDA ITEM OR SUBJECT FOR DISCUSSION AT INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS RATHER THAN PRECONDITION. [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] URGED THAT PRESENT OPPORTUNITY RESUME INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS NOT BE MISSED. END SUMMARY.


3. IN COURSE OF LENGTHY PRESENTATION BY  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  OF [[TURKISH || 10]] ECONOMIC NEEDS AND DEVELOPMENT DURING 1978, [[PRIME MINISTER || 6]] MENTIONED THAT [[GOT || 11]] HAD ENCOURAGED [[TURKISH CYPRIOTS|| 12]] TO MAKE TIMELY AND HELPFUL MOVES WHICH [[HE|| 6]] HOPED HAD BEEN USEFUL TO [[ADMINISTRATION ||13 ]].  [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] LATER NOTED THAT  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  HAD REFERRED TO [[CYPRUS || 3]]  AND THAT [[HE ||1]] HAD DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE WITH [[THE PRIME MINISTER || 6]] ON PRE- VIOUS OCCASIONS. IN INTRODUCING SUBJECT OF [[CYPRUS || 3]] ,  [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] STRESSED THAT [[HE|| 1]] DID NOT WANT TO LINK MATTER TO ANY OTHER ISSUE. HOWEVER, [[CYPRUS || 3]]  WAS IMPORTUESTION FOR [[USG || 14]].  [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] SAID [[HE || 1]] WAS AWARE THAT [[DENKTASH || 8]] HAD RESPONDED TO [[WALDHEIM || 2]] ON JANUARY 9 AND THAT [[GREEK CYPRIOTS|| 15]] HAD ANNOUNCED [[THEIR||15]] ACCEPTANCE OF [[SECRETARY GENERAL'S || 2]] PROPOSED APPROACH. [[DENKTASH’S || 8]] ACCEPTANCE OF  [[WALDHEIM || 2]] PROPOSAL SEEMED ON QUICK READING TO HAVE TWO TROUBLING ASPECTS: A) LANGUAGE ON [[VAROSHA || 7]] SEEMED TO BE A STEP BACK FROM JULY PROPOSAL; AND B) SUGGESTION THAT REMOVAL OF ECONOMIC BLOCKADE SHOULD OCCUR AT THRESHOLD OF TALKS.  [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] STRESSED THAT PRIMARY RESPON- SIBILITY BELONGS WITH [[SECRETARY GENERAL || 2]], BUT [[HE || 1]] FELT IT INCUMBENT ON [[HIM || 1]] TO EMPHASIZE IMPORTANCE OF [[TURKISH CYPRIOTS ||12]] GIVING A POSITIVE RESPONSE AT A TIME WHEN RESUMPTION OF INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS SEEMED SO CLOSE. [[TURKISH CYPRIOTS ||12]] WERE PUTTING [[THEMSELVES||12]]  IN DIFFICULT TACTICAL POSITION IN FAILING TO GIVE MORE STRAIGHT- FORWARD POSITIVE RESPONSE.


4.  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  CONSULTED WITH [[OKCUN || 4]] AND  [[ELEKDAG || 5]] AND RE-READ LANGUAGE OF [[DENKTASH || 8]] RESPONSE. [[HE|| 6]] STRESSED THAT [[TURKISH CYPRIOTS ||12]] WOULD NOT GO BACK ON JULY PROPOSAL AND THAT NEW PARAGRAPH 3A IN JANUARY 9 PAPER WAS NOT SO INTENDED. THERE COULD BE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MODALITIES IN ADVANCE OF INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS, WITH SETTLEMENT TO OCCUR IN PHASE WITH THOSE TALKS.  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  SAID THAT NEW LANGUAGE SIMPLY REPRESENTED SHORTER VERSION OF PREVIOUS PROPOSAL, WHICH STILL STOOD.  [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] EXPRESSED HOPE THAT [[SECRETARY GENERAL||2]] COULD WORK OUT SATISFACTORY LANGUAGE ON THIS POINT.


5.  [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] SAID [[HE || 1]] COULD UNDERSTAND HOW ECONOMIC ASPECTS COULD BE DISCUSSED DURING TALKS, BUT IF [[TURKISH CYPRIOTS ||12]] INSISTED ON REMOVAL OF ECONOMIC BLOCKADE AS PRECONDITION TO BEGIN TALKS OR AT THRESHOLD OF TALKS, THIS WOULD BE NEW ISSUE WHICH WOULD NOT BE EASY TO RESOLVE.  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  AND  [[ELEKDAG || 5]] DESCRIBED THEIR CONCERN ABOUT BLOCKADE BUT STRESSED THIS WAS AGENDA SUGGESTION THAT WAS NOT CONDITION WHICH HAD TO BE SATISFIED BEFORE SITTING AT TABLE. [[CHRISTOPHXPRESSED|| 1]]  HOPE THAT  [[WALDHEIM || 2]] COULD FIND SKILLFUL WAY TO MAKE CLEAR THAT ECONOMIC BLOCKADE DID NOT HAVE TO BE RESOLVED BUT ONLY DISCUSSED.  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  EXPRESSED HOPE THAT [[GREEK CYPRIOTS|| 15]] COULD MAKE GOOD WILL GESTURE, E.G. TO STOP ARRESTING SHIP CAPTAINS CALLING AT [[FAMAGUSTA || 3]].  [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] SAID [[WE || 24]] HAD BEEN PLEASED BY MOVEMENT ON [[CYPRIOT|| 3]]  QUESTION AND WANTED VERY MUCH TO HAVE ALL CONCERNED TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PRESENT CHANCE TO GET NEGOTIATIONS STARTED. IT WAS UP TO  [[WALDHEIM || 2]] TO PROCEED, BUT [[HE|| 1]]  HAD WANTED TO SHARE [[HIS|| 1]]  PERCEPTION AND CONCERNS ON [[VAROSHA|| 7]]  AND INTRODUCTION OF NEW ECONOMIC BLOCKADE MATTER. [[WE || 24]] THOUGHT POSITIONS OF [[TWO SIDES ||23]] WERE CLOSE TOGETHER AND HOPED THAT REMAINING GAPS COULD QUICKLY BE BRIDGED.


6.  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  AND  [[ELEKDAG || 5]] EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN ABOUT DEGREE OF CONTACTS BETWEEN BOTH  [[WALDHEIM || 2]] AND [[GALINDO POHL||16]] AND [[ROLANDIS || 17]] AND ARGUED THAT [[TURKISH CYPRIOT ||12]] DELAY IN RESPONDING HAD BEEN DUE TO INTERNAL POLITICAL PROBLEMS IN [[NORTHERN CYPRUS || 9]] .


7. TOWARD END OF CONVERSATION  [[ECEVIT || 6]]  ONCE AGAIN REITERATED [[HIS|| 6]]  HOPE THAT INTERCOMMUNAL TALKS WILL RESUME SOON. [[HE|| 6]] EXPRESSED VIEW THAT [[GREEK CYPRIOTS|| 15]]  WERE STILL NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN SOLUTION AND THAT TALKS MIGHT WELL DRAG ON, THUS AFFECTING [[TURKISH||11]]/[[GREEK ||18]] RELATIONS AS WELL.


8. FOR [[USUN || 19]]: [[YOU || 19]]  MAY CONVEY SUMMARY OF  [[CHRISTOPHER || 1]] CONVERSATION WITH  [[WALDHEIM || 2]] TO [[URQUHART || 20]] OR [[SHERRY|| 21]], PARTICULARLY STRESSING [[TURKISH ||11]] POINT THAT [[VAROSHA || 7]] FORMULATION IN JANUARY 9 REDRAFT WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE CHANGE IN JULY [[DENKTASH || 8]] PROPOSAL AND THAT ECONOMIC BLOCKADE PARAGRAPH WAS INTENDED TO BE SUBJECT FOR DISCUSSION IN TALKS RATHER THAN PRECONDITION FOR RESUMPTION. [[YOU || 19]]  SHOULD ALSO CONVEY [[DEPUTY SECRETARY'S || 1]] BELIEF THAT NEUTRAL PHRASEOLOGY CAN POSSIBLY BE DEVELOPED ON LATTER POINT. [[DEPUTY SECRETARY||1]] HOPES THAT [[GALINDO POHL||16]] COULD TRY TO WORK OUT MINIMAL LANGUAGE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE SATISFACTORY TO [[BOTH CYPRIOT COMMUNITIES || 23]].


9. FOR [[NICOSIA || 25]] : [[YOU || 25]] MAY ALSO SHARE FOREGOING WITH [[GALINDO POHL|| 16]], NOTING  [[USUN || 19]] WILL BE DISCUSSING MATTER WITH [[SECRETARIAT OFFICIALS || 2]].
