1. [[([[LOU|| 1]]) [[PRIME MINISTER RAMGOOLAM'S || 2]] LABOR PARTY || 3]] HELD [[[[ITS||3]] ANNUAL CONGRESS || 4]] LAST WEEKEND. [[RAGMOOLAM || 2]], IN [[HIS || 2]] ADDRESS TO [[THE DELE- GATES || 4]], MADE A STANDARD POLITICAL SPEECH. TWO POINTS OF INTEREST WERE [[HIS || 2]] DISAVOWAL OF ANY INTENTION TO FORM A COALITION WITH [[THE OPPOSITION MMM PARTY || 5]] AND [[HIS || 2]] DECLARATION OF [[HIS || 2]] CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE EXISTING COALITION BETWEEN [[LABOR  || 3]] AND [[THE PMSD || 6]]. [[RAMGOOLAM ||2]] DENCOUNCED [[THE MMM || 5]] AS A “[[COMMUNIST PARTY || 7]] ." [[LABOR PARTY DISSIDENTS [[HARISH BOODHOO || 8]], [[ROHIT BEEDASSY|| 9]] AND [[RADAHKRISHNA GUNGOOSINGH || 10]]  || 11]] DID NOT ATTEND THE CONGRESS BUT WERE THE SUBJECT OF MUCH ACRIMONIOUS DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. [[THE PRIME MINISTER  || 2]] BLOCKED A WELL SUPPORTED MOTION CALLING FOR EXPULSION OF [[THE DISDIDENTS ||11]] FROM [[THE PARTY || 3]] AND [[THE PARTY EXECUTIVE || 12]] . [[FOREIGN MIN- ISTER WALTER || 13]] STAGED ANOTHER OF [[HIS ||13]] HISTRIONIC WALKOUTS OVER  [[THE CONGRESS' || 4]] DECISION NOT TO EXPELL [[BOODHOO || 8]] AND [[HIS [[ASSOCIATES  || 11]] || 8]] . IT LASTED FOR TEN MINUTES.
(C) COMMENT: [[RAMGOOLAM'S || 2]] CHARACTERIZATION OF [[THE MMM || 5]] AS [[COMMUNIST ||7 ]] ECHOED WHAT [[HE|| 2]] SAID TO [[THE AMBASSADOR|| 36]] IN PRIVATE TWO DAYS EARLIER. [[THE PRIME MINISTER'S || 2]] RELUCTANCE TO SEE [[THE THREE DISSIDENTS || 11]] EXPELLED PROBABLY INDICATES THAT [[HE || 2]] STILL HAS SOME HOPE, HOWEVER FAINT, OF BRINGING [[THEM|| 11]] BACK UNDER [[PARTY ||3]] DISCIPLINE.


2. (C) A  [[[[SOVIET || 15]] NAVAL TASK FORCE || 16]] OF FOUR SHIPS: THE PETROPAULOVSK- KARA CLASS CRUISER, THE IVANROGOV-AMPHIBIOUS ASSAULTSHIP, THE NEMAN-AUXILIARY SHIP, AND THE LEADER, MINSK-KEIV CLASS AIRCRAFT CARRIER ARRIVED IN [[PORT LOUIS ||1]] ON APRIL 26 FOR WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A TWO-DAY VISIT. IT APPEARS THAT [[THE SOVIETS || 15]] DID NOT REQUEST [[GOM ||17]] CLEARANCE FOR THE VISIT VERY MUCH IN ADVANCE. [[[[MEA ||  18]] PERMANENT SECRETARY DUVAL || 19]] TOLD [[THE DCM || 20]] ON APRIL 26 THAT [[THE [[SOVIET || 15]] AMBASSADOR || 21]] HAD MENTIONED THE VISIT VAGUELY TO [[HIM || 19]] AT A PARTY ON APRIL 22. IN RESPONSE TO [[THE DCM'S || 20]] QUESTION, [[DUVAL || 19]] SAID [[HE || 19]] DID NOT RECALL SEEING A DIPLOMATIC NOTE ASKING FOR CLEARANCE FOR THE VISIT.
(U) COMMENT: THE MINSK IS OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED AS A CRUISER BY [[THE SOVIETS || 15]] IN ORDER TO PAY LIP SERVICE TO [[MONTREUX || 22]] CONVENTION RESTRICTIONS ON ENTRY AND EGRESS TO AND FROM [[THE BLACK SEA || 23]].


3. ([[LOU|| 1]]) A DEMOSTRATION AGAINST [[THE [[U.S.|| 24]]  NAVAL ||25 ]] PRESENCE IN [[DIEGO GARCIA || 26]] AND ADVOCATING BETTER TREATMENT FOR [[DISPLACED FORMER RESIDENTS OF [[THAT ISLAND || 26]] ||27]] WAS HELD IN [[PORT LOUIS ||1]] ON APRIL 23. A DELEGATION OF FIVE VISITED [[THE EMBASSY || 28]] TO PRESENT A PETITION CALLING FOR [[THE U.S. || 24]] TO LEAVE [[DIEGO GARCIA || 26]], THE RESTORA- TION OF [[THE ISLAND ||26]] TO [[MAURITIAN || 17]] SOVEREIGNTY AND FOR [[THE U.S.|| 24]] TO "FACT UP TO [[ITS|| 24]] RESPONSIBILITIES" FOR [[THE DISPLACED DIEGO GARCIANS || 27]]. THE DEMONSTRATION RECEIVED A FAIR AMOUNT OF PUBLICITY THE FOLLOWING DAY. ([[PORT LOUIS|| 1]] 0627)


4. (U) [[THE UNIVERSITY OF [[MAURITIUS || 1]] || 29]] HAS REMAINED CLOSED SINCE A STUDENT DEMONSTRATION SOME TWO WEEKS AGO. THER APPEARS TO BE LITTLE SERIOUS PRESSURE FROM ANYONE, INCLUDING STUDENTS, TO RE- OPEN THE SCHOOL.


5. (U) ACCORDING TO ALL INDICATIONS, SUGAR LOANDING IN THE PORT IS PROCEEDING AT A PACE WHICH WILL ENABLE [[MAURITIUS ||1]] TO MEET [[ITS ||1]] QUOTA FOR SUGAR SALES AT HIGHLY SUBSIDIZED PRICES T [[THE EEC || 30]] THIS YEAR. FAILURE TO MEET THE TOTAL 500,000 TON QUOTA IN ANY GIVEN YEAR COULD RESULT IN AN ABSOLUTE REDUCTION IN THE QUOTA FOR ALL FUTURE YEARS BY THE AMOUNT OF SUGAR NOT SHIPPED IN TIME.


6. (C) [[VICE ADMIRAL FOLEY || 31]], [[COMMANDER || 31]], SEVENTH FLEET, IS PAYING A HIGHLY USEFUL TWO-DAY VISIT TO [[MAURITIUS || 1]] WHICH HAS COINCIDED WITH THE PRESENCE OF [[THE [[SOVIET || 15]] SQUADRON || 16]], INCLUDING [[THE NEW CARRIER/CRUSIER MINSKSAND REAR ADMIRAL VARGANOV || 34]] . CALLS BY [[ADMIRAL FOLEY || 31]] AND [[AMBASSADOR || 36]] ON [[PRIME MINISTER ||2]] AND [[ACTING GOVERNOR GENERAL WARE || 32]] A VAULABLE MANIFESTATION OF CONTINUED [[U.S.||24]] PRESENCE IN [[THE INDIAN OCEAN || 33]] AND EMPHATIC INTENTION TO STAY. [[PRIME MINISTER ||2]]  GAVE LUNCHEON FOR [[ADMIRAL FOLEY || 31]] TO WHICH, WITH [[OUR || 28]] HEARTY CONCURRENCE, [[HE ||2]] INVITED [[[[SOVIET || 15]]  ADMIRAL ||34]]. AMID EXCHANGES OF COURTESIES BETWEEN TWO [[FLAG OFFICERS || 35]], [[ADMIRAL FOLEY || 31]] MADE VIGOROUS REITERATION OF OFFER TO PAY COURTESY CALL ON [[[[HIS ||31]] SOVIET COLLEAGUE ||  34]] ABOARD [[LATTER'S||34]] FLAGSHIP. AFTER BOBBING AND WEAVING, [[SOVIET ADMIRAL ||34]] AT END OF LUNCH SAID [[HE||34]] WOULD TRY T FIT IN SUCH A OCCASION IN [[HIS||34]] OVERCROWDED SCHEDULE. [[WE ||28]] AWAIT OUTCOME (DOUBTLESS VIA FLASH MESSAGE EXCHANGE WITH [[MOSCOW||15]]) WITH GREAT INTEREST.
