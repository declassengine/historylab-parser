1. SUMMARY: REACTION TO [[[[FRANGIE || 3]] CABINET ||1 ]] RESHUFFLE AND APPOINTMENT OF [[CHAMOUN || 2]] AS [[ACTING PRIME MINISTER  || 2]] ALMOST UNIVERSALLY HOSTILE. [[FRANGIE || 3]]/[[CHAMOUN  || 2]] CAN NOW PRESSURE [[SARKIS || 4]] AND, WITH [[SKAFF  || 5]] AS [[MINISTER OF FINANCE || 5]], CAN EFFECT NUMBER OF LAST-MINUTE APPOINTMENTS AND CHANGES WHICH [[KARAME || 6]] HAD BEEN HOLDING UP. MAY 20 [[CABINET || 1]] MEETING UNLIKELY TO HAVE QUORUM. END SUMMARY.


2. [[LEBANESE ||7]] POLITICAL CIRCLES ARE REACTING IN PREDICTABLE FASHION TO [[PRESIDENT FRANGIE'S  || 3]] MOVE ON SEPTEMBER 15 RESHUFFLING [[CABINET || 1]] (SEE REFTEL). AMONG [[TRADITIONAL MOSLEM LEADERS || 10]], [[PRIME MINISTER KARAME || 6]] SAID "[[I  || 6]] CONSIDER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO BE A STAB IN THE BACK...THIS ACTION IS EAGAINST THE CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM AND TRADITION SINCE 1943."; [[SAEB SALAM || 9]] SAID "[[I  || 9]] CONDEMN THIS ACTION... [[WE || 10]] FIND CRIMINALS...PERSISTING IN THEIR CRIMES." [[PDLAMIC COUNCIL  || 12]] ISSUED AHPATEMENT DESCRIBING [[FRANGIE'S || 3]] ACTION "AS A FLAGRANT VIOLANT OF CONSTITUTIONAL PRACTICE." [[[[PHALANGE ||13]] LEADER PIERRE CEMAYLE || 11]] IS REPORTED TO HAVE REPEATED [[HIS  || 13]] SON'S STATEMENT THAT [[[[HIS  || 11]] PARTY  || 13]] WAS NOT CONSULTED AND COMMENTED RATHER LAMELY THAT [[MR. FRANGIE  || 3]] MUST HAVE HAD [[HIS || 3]] REASONS. [[DEFEATED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE RAYMOND EDDE  || 14]] CRITICIZED [[FRANGIE'S || 3]] ACTION BUT STRESSED THAT IF [[SARKIS || 4]] CAN ASSUME OFFICE, [[HE  || 4]] CAN QUICKLY NULLIFY THESE DECISIONS. [[JUNBLATT'S [[NATIONAL MOVEMENT || 16]]  || 15]]  CONDEMNED MOVE AND SOME NEWSPAPERS REGARDING IT AS FIRST STEP TOWARDS PARTITION.


3. PURPOSE OF THIS [[FRANGIE || 3]]/[[CHAMOUN || 2]] MOVE APPEARS TO BE TWOFOLD -- TO STRENGTHEN [[THEIR  || 17]] POSITION BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER INAUGURATION OF [[SARKIS || 4]]. AS MMINISTERS OF DEFENSE AND FINANCE, [[CHAMOUN  || 2]] AND [[SKAFF || 5]]  CAN NOW ISSUE ORDERS THAT [[KARAME || 6]] HAS BEEN DELAYING FOR MONTHS. AS [[ACTING PRIME MINISTER || 2]], [[CHAMOUN'S || 2]] POWER IN WANING DAYS OF [[[[FRANGIE || 3]] REGIME || 18]] IS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED. ALTHOUGH LESS THAN A WEEK REMAINS BEFORE [[SARKIS ||4 ]] IS TO BE SWORN IN, [[CHAMOUN  || 2]] HAS ANNOUNCED THAT A [[CABINET || 1]] MEETING WILL BE HELD ON MONDAY, SEP 20. SUCH A MEETING WOULD ENABLE [[FRANGIE || 3]]/[[CHAMOUN || 2]] TO MAKE A NUMBER OF NEW APPOINTMENTS, SUCH AS DIRECTOR OF [[CENTRAL BANK  || 20]] AND GOVERNOR OF [[MT. LEBANON || 19]], AND FILL A NUMBER OF KEY VACANCIES IN [[ARMY  || 21]] AND [[CIVIL SERVICE ||22 ]]. EVEN IF [[SARKIS  || 4]] WERE TO DISMISS MANY OF THESE MAN A WEEK LATER, (AND POLITICALLY IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR [[HIM || 4]] TO DO SO) THEY WOULD THEN BE ENTITLED TO HANDSOME PENSIONS. 


4. THERE IS STILL A QUESTION, HOWEVER, CONCERNING HOW MANY [[MINISTERS || 23]] WILL ATTEND [[CABINET || 1]] MEETIMG. [[CHAMOUN || 2]] AND [[SKAFF || 5]] CERTAINLY WILL. [[KARAME || 6]], EVEN IF [[HE ||6]] RETURNS FROM [[CAIRO||24]] IN TIME, PROBABLY WILL NOT, FOR BOTH POLITICAL AND SECURITY REASONS (MEETING WILL BE HELD IN [[[[CHRISTIAN || 26]]-CONTROLLED EAST BEIRUT|| 25]]). [[OSSEIRAN || 27]], WHO WAS DISMISSED AS MINISTER OF ECONOMY, WHILE KEEPING OTHER POSTS, IS INSULTED AND SULKING AND WILL PROBABLY STAY AWAY. [[MAJID ARSLAN || 28]], [[THE [[DRUZE  || 29]] MEMBER || 28]], IS IN POOR HEALTH WHICH [[HE  || 28]] WILL PROBABLY USE AS AN EXCUSE TO STAY HOME. THUS THE KEY MAN IS [[GHASSAN TUEINI || 30]], WHO HAS BEEN TRYING TO PLAY A CONCILIATORY ROLE BETWEEN THE [[KFOUR FRONT || 31]] AND THE TRADITIONAL [[[[MOSLEM LEADERS || 10 ]] OF MWIZAT [[BEIRUT  || 7]] || 32]]. IF [[HE  || 30]] DECIDED NOT TO GO, THERE WILL BE NO QUORUM. [[L'ORIENT || 33]] 18 SEPTEMBER REPORTS [[TUEINI || 30]] HAD NOT, AS OF SEPTEMBER 17, RECEIVED NOTICE OF [[COUNCIL  || 1]] MEETING AND IN ANY CASE WOULD BE OUT OF [[COUNTRY || 7]] SEPTEMBER 20 DUE TO PRIOR COMMITMENTS.


5. COMMENT: THIS LAST-MINUTE [[CABINET|| 1]] RESHUFFLE HAS RAISED THE POLITICAL TEMPERATURE AND MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR [[SARKIS || 4]] TO APPOINT A [[CABINET || 1]] OF TECHNOCRATS AND INITIATE A [[LEBANESE||7 ]] -[[LEBANESE|| 7]] DIALOGUE IN A MORE RELAXED ATMOSPHERE. [[FRANGIE || 3]]/[[CHAMOUN || 2]] MAY HAVE DELIBERATELY TAKEN THIS STEP TO MAKE THINGS AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE FOR [[SARKIS|| 4]], HOPING THAT [[HE|| 4]] WILL FAIL TO ACHIEVE A MEANINGFUL CEASE-FIRE. THIS IN TURN MIGHT PERSUADE [[THE SYRIANS || 34]] TO GO FOR THE "MILITARY OPTION" WHICH [[FRANGIE || 3]]/[[CHAMOUN || 2]] BELIEVE IS INEVITABLE. REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, [[FRANGIE’S || 3]] ACTION MEANS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF [[LEBANON || 7]] PRACTICALLY ALL THE EXECUTIVE POWER IS IN THE HANDS OF [[THE MARONITES|| 35]].
