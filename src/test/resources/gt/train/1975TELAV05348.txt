1. INCIPIENT POWER STRUGGLE BETWEEN [[PRIME MINISTER RABIN ||1]] AN [[[[HIS || 1]] ADVISOR ARIEL" ARIK" SHARON || 2]] ON ONE HAND AND [[DEFENSE MINISER PERS || 3]] AND [[CHIEF OF STAFF GUR || 4]] ON OTHE HAS SURFACED AGAIN IN MINI-FLAP ARISING OUT OF [[RABIN'S || 1 ]] DECISION LAST WEEK TO CONDUCT A FRONTLINE TOUR OF THE PASSES. WHILE OSTENSIBLE ISSUE WAS QUESTON OF WHETHR IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR [[RABIN ||1]] TO BRING [[[[HIS || 1]] ADVISER || 2]] WITH [[HIM || 1 ]] ON SUCH A TOUR, REAL ISSUE WAS DEEPENING CONCERN OF [[PERES || 3]] AND [[GUR  || 3]] THAT [[ SHARON || 2]]  APPOINTMEN MAY BE UNDERCUTTING THEIR AUTHORITY, AND MAY PRESAGE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN [[RABIN ||1]] AND THEMSELVES ON POLICY DECISIONS RE [[IDF || 5]] STRATEGY AND PREPAREDNESS. FOLLOWING IS [[EMBASSY||6]] RRECONSTRUCTION OF INCIDENT, BASED ON PRESS AND OTHER SOURCES.


2.  [[RABIN ||1]] LASTWEEK ANNOUNCED HIS INTENTION TO TOUR AND PASSES" IN ORDER TO EXAMINE VITAL POINTS" AND INDICATED THAT [[SHARON || 2]]  WOULD BE ACCOMPANYING [[HIM || 1]]. [[GUR ||4]] REPORTEDLY FIRS INFORMED [[PERES || 3]] THT IN TIS CASE [[HE || 1]] WOULD BRING NO OTHER SENIOR OFFICERS WITH [[HIM || 1]] AND THEN CHANGED THIS TO SAY THAT [[HE || 1]]  WOULD NOT COME ON TOUR AT ALL. AT THAT POINT, [[RABIN ||1]]  SENT WORD BACK THAT [[HE || 1]]  WAS CANCELLING TOUR UNTIL MATTER WAS CLARIFIED. [[RABIN ||1]]  THEN CALLED IN [[PERES || 3]] AND JUSTICE MINISTER [[ZADOK || 7]], ASKING LATTER FOR ADVIE ON LEGAL STATUS OF [[SHARON ||2]] APPOINTMENT. [[ZADOK || 7]] REAFFIRMED LEGAL OPINION [[HE || 7]] HAD FURNISHED [[RABIN ||1]]  EARLIER THIS SUMMER, TO EFFECT THAT [[PRIME MINISTER||1]] COULD USE HIS ADVISERS AS [[HE || 1]]  LIKES. UPSHOT OF THESE MEETINGS WAS THAT TOUR OF PASSES TOOK PLACE ON AUGUST 9 WITH BOTH [[SHARON ||2]]  AND [[GUR ||4]] IN ATTENDANCE. DISTINCTLY TENSE ATMOSPHERE PREVAILED. ACCORDING TO ONE SOURCE, [[SHARON ||2]]  COMMENTED DURING TOUR THAT [[SOUTHERN COMMAND || 8]] CLEARLY WAS NOT READY FOR NEW WAR, LEADING TO BITTEREXCHANE WITH [[GUR || 4]] [[WHO ||4]] VIGOROUSLY REJECTD THE CHARGE,


3. COMMENT: BROUHAHA OVER" AFFAIR OF [[SHARON'S ||2 ]] TOUR THROUGH THE PASSES" IS BY ITSELF NOT A MAJOR INCIDENT, AND [[WE || 6]] DO NOT EXPECT ANY DRAMATIC DEV- ELOPMENTS SUCH AS RESIGNATIONS TO ARISE FROM IT. IT IS HOWEVER,CLEAR CONFIRMATION OF DISSATISFACTION ON PART OF [[PERES || 3]] AND [[GUR || 4]] WITH [[SHARON || 2]] APPOINTMENT, AND OFKRICTION IN RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN [[RABIN ||1]]  AND [[PERES || 3]] WHICH HAS RESULTED FROM IT. MORE SERIOUS QUESTONS MAY ARISE IF AND WHEN [[PRIME MINISTER||1]], UPON [[SHARON'S ||2]] RECOMMENDATON, ATTEMPTS TO IMPLE- MENT CHANGES IN STRATEGIC OR OTHER POLICY CONSID- ERATIONS AFFECTING THE [[IDF || 5]] WHICH MIGHT BE UNACCEPT- ABE TO [[GUR || 4]]  AND/OR [[PERES || 3]].
