1. (C-ENTIRE TEXT)


2. [[THE PRESIDENT OF [[PARAGUAY || 1]], GENERAL ALFREDO STROESSNER || 2]], WILL CELEBRATE THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF [[HIS ||2]] FORMAL ELECTION OF OFFICE ON AUGUST 15. EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND WITH [[AMBASSADOR WHITE || 3]] BEFORE [[HIS|| 3]] DEPARTURE ON HOME LEAVE REGARDING PARTICIPATION, IF ANY, IN WHATEVER ACTIVITIES ARE PLANNED FOR THIS OCCASION. IN THE LAST WEEK, [[THE CHARGE|| 19]] HAS CONSULTED WITH THE [[AMBASSADORS ||4]]OF [[GREAT BRITAIN || 5]], [[FRANCE|| 6]], [[GERMANY|| 7]] AND [[ITALY || 8]] ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS AND TOOK PART IN A LUNCHEON ON AUGUST 4 AT WHICH [[THE FORIEGN OFFICE CHIEF OF PROTOCOL || 20]] DIS- CUSSED ANNVIERSARY PLANS. [[HE ||20]] TOLD A GROUP OF DCMS AND CHARGES THAT NO PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE WILL BE GIVEN THE OCC ASION APART FROM THE NORMAL PARADE, WREATH-LAYING AND RECEPTION HELD TO CELEBRATE THE FOUNDING OF ASUNCION ON THE SAME DATE. SPECIAL INVITATIONS ARE BEING SENT BY [[THE PRESIDENT ||2]] TO SPECIFIC FOREIGN INVITEES TO TAKE PART IN SOME PUBLIC CEREMONIES TO MARK [[HIS  ||2]] 25TH ANNIVERSARY BUT NOT [[NATIONAL ||1]] DELEGATIONS WILL BE INVITIED.


3. THE EUROPEAN AMBASSADORS HAVE NOT YET DECIDED WHAT TO DO FOR THE AUGUST 15 ANNIVERSARY. [[PARIS ||6]] HAS ADVISED [[THE FRENCH AMBASSADOR || 9]] THAT NO MESSAGE WILL BE SENT FROM [[PRESIDENT GISCARD || 10]] AND THAT [[HE || 9]] SHOULD LIMIT [[HIS || 9]] PARTICIPATION TO LOW- KEY ATTENDANCE AT WHATEVER EVENTS ARE. [[THE GERMAN AMBASSADOR || 11]] HAS MADE THE SAME RECOMMENDATION TO [[BONN || 7]], AS HAS [[THE BRITISH AMBASSADOR  || 12]], TO [[LONDON || 5]],. [[THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY  || 13]],WILL NOT SEND A SPECIAL MESSAGE OR NAME ANY HIGH-LEVEL REPRE- SENTATIVE FOR THE OCCASION. [[THE ITALIAN AMBASSADOR || 14]], WHO ARRIVED A SHORT TIME AGO AND IS ANXIOUS TO INGRATIATE [[HIMSELF || 14]] WITH [[THE GOVERNMENT || 8]] AT RELATIVELY SMALL COST, MAY RECOMMEND TO [[ROME  || 8]] A PRIVATE MESSAGE FROM [[THE ITALIAN PRESIDENT  || 15]] SALUTING [[STROESSNER || 2]], ON [[HIS || 2]], 25TH ANNIVERSARY. THE OTHER AMBASSADORS THINK THIS IS A BAD IDEA AND ARE DISCOURAGING [[HIM || 14]].


4. BEFORE [[HIS ||3]] DEPARTURE, [[AMBASSADOR WHITE ||3]] CONSIDERED SENDING A BRIEF MESSAGE SIGNED BY [[THE CHARGE || 19]] BUT RECOMMENDED AGAINST ANY ACTION BY [[WASHINGTON || 16]] TAKING COGNIZANCE OF THE OCCASION. BECAUSE NO SPECIAL FESTIVITIES ARE PLANNED AND BECAUSE THE EURPOEAN AMBASSADORS WITH WHOM [[WE || 17]] WORK CLOSELY ON HUMAN RIGHTS WILL NOT BE SENDING ANY MESSAGE OF CONGRATULATIONS, [[WE ||17]] RECOMMEND THAT [[WASHINGTON || 16]] TAKE NO NOTICE OF [[STROESSNER'S || 2]] ANNIVERSARY AND, APART FROM ATTENDING CERE- MONIES AT THE CHARGE LEVEL,  [[WE ||17]] WILL NOT MAKE ANY FORMAL GESTURE RECOGNIZING THE OCCASION, E.G. SENDING WREATH, NOTE, ETC. REQUEST [[DEPARTMENT'S || 18]] APPROVAL FOR THIS COURSE OF ACTION.
