3. SECOND ATTACK BY [[[[ DNTAC || 3 ]] OFFICIAL WITTE ||  5]] MADE IN MEMO TO [[ DIRECTOR || 5]] DATED APRIL 26. ( FIRST WAS DATED APRIL 12. BOTH POUCHED TO [[ SILBERSTEIN || 6]]). PARTIAL OUTCOME IS THAT [[ WITTE  [[( AIR FORCE || 7 ]] COMODORO RETIRED) || 5 ]] REPORTEDLY HAS BEEN ARRESTED ON ORDER OF [[[[ AIR FORCE || 7  ]] HEAD REY || 16 ]] AND CONFINED AT [[TANDIL || 8 ]]  FOR 30 DAYS.


4. [[ WITTE || 5  ]] MEMO OF 26 APRIL REITERATES ILLEGALITY UNDER [[ ARGENTINE ||  9 ]] LAW OF ARRENGEMENT WITH [[ U. S. || 10 ]], EMPHASIZING PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS. MEMO FURTHER STATES THAT MEMO OF CONSULTATION HAS NO VALIDITY UNDER [[ U. S. || 10 ]],  LAW, CITING SIGNED 1947 BILATERAL WHICH DID NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR LACK OF RATIFICATION OF PLANNED ROUTES.


5.

6. GREAT WISDOM OF CAB EXTRAORDINARY " SHOW- CAUSE" PROCEDURE ON [[ AEROLINEAS CO || 14 ]]- TERMINALIZATION IS HIGHLIGHTED BY EVENTS. [[OUR || 10 ]] CIVAIR RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES AS INTENSE NATIONALISTIC ISSUE LOCALLY. BECAUSE A RUPTURE COULD BADLY SHAKE OTHER AREAS, THE MOST PUNCTILIOUS PERFORMANCE ON THE INTENT OF THE ARRANGEMENT IS WARRANTED.
