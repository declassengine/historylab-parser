1. [[MFA OFFICIALS || 1]] HAVE INFORMED [[E/C COUNSELOR|| 2]] THAT, TO [[THEIR|| 1]] KNOWLEDGE, [[THE SOLE [[SWEDISH|| 3]] RECIPIENT OF A TARGET LETTER ||5 ]] FROM [[JUSTICE|| 4]] IS [[ARNE KOCH|| 5]], AN [[EXECUTIVE OF [[THE SHIPPING LINE BROSTROM|| 6]] || 5]]. [[KOCH ||5 ]] HAS BEEN IN TOUCH WITH [[THE MFA|| 1]], AND HAS SAID [[HE|| 5]] WILL SEEK ACTION THROUGH [[THE [[SWEDISH|| 3]] SHIPOWNERS ASSOCIATION|| 7]], ALTHOUGH [[HE|| 5]] DID NOT SPECIFY WHAT ACTION [[HE|| 5]] SEEKS.


2. [[MFA OFFICIALS || 1]] RAISED THIS TOPIC IN A LOW KEY (DURING THE COURSE OF A SCHEDULED GET-TOGETHER ON ANOTHER TOPIC), AND INDICATED [[THEY|| 1]] ARE AWAITING WORD FROM [[THE [[SWEDISH|| 3]] SHIPOWNERS ASSOCIATION|| 7]] BEFORE DECIDING HOW TO PROCEED. [[THEY|| 1]] STRESSED THAT [[KOCH|| 5]] COULD AVAIL [[HIMSELF|| 5]] OF A [[SWEDISH || 3]] LAW WHICH PROHIBITS INDIVIDUALS FROM GIVING CERTAIN INFORMATION TO OTHER GOVERNMENTS. [[THEY|| 1]] ALSO COMMENTED THAT THE TEXT OF [[JUSTICE'S || 4]] TARGET LETTER, AS RELEASED TO [[THEM||1]] FROM [[THEIR|| 1]] [[EMBASSY IN [[WASHINGTON || 9]] || 8]], SEEMS UNNECESSARILY HARSH, AND SOMEWHAT UNSUITABLE FOR SENDING TO NON-[[AMERICANS || 9]] SINCE THE WORDING IS EVIDENTLY BOILER-PLATE INTENDED FOR TRANSMITTAL TO [[US RESIDENTS ||9]] (E.G., ITS INVITATION TO THE RECIPIENT TO TELEPHONE [[JUSTICE|| 4]] TO DISCUSS THE MATTER).


3. [[EMBASSY || 10]] COMMENT: WHILE [[THE SWEDES || 1]] ARE PLAYING A LOW KEY ON THIS MATTER SO FAR, THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT [[THEY|| 1]] ARE PREPARED TO MOVE VIGOROUSLY ONCE [[THEY|| 1]] HAVE COORDINATED WITH [[THE [[SWEDISH|| 3]] SHIPOWNERS ASSOCIATION|| 7]].
