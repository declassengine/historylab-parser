FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES AGREED UPON WITH PERINAT.



1. [[THE GOVERNMENTS OF [[SPAIN || 1]] AND [[THE UNITED STATES ||2]]  || 3]] DECLARE THAT [[THEIR || 3]] COOPERATION SINCE 1953 HAS BEEN BENEFICIAL FOR THE SECURITY OF [[BOTH COUNTRIES ||3]], HAS STRENGTHENED THE DEFENSE OF [[THE WEST || 4]] AND HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE MAINTENANCE OF WORLD PEACE, WITH [[SPAIN || 1]] PLAYING AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS REGARD IN [[THE ATLANTIC || 5]] AND [[MEDITERRANEAN || 6 ]] ZONES.


2. [[THEY ||3]] PROCLAIM [[THEIR ||3]] RESOLVE TO PURSUE [[THEIR ||3]] EFFORTS FOR THE CONSOLIDATION OF PEACE, AS WELL AS ON BEHALF OF DETENTE, AND TO THIS END [[THEY ||3]] PARTICIPATE IN THE CONFERENCE OF SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN [[EUROPE ||7]] AND IN IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS WHILE [[THEY ||3]] REAFFIRM [[THEIR ||3]] FAITH IN THE PURPOSES AND PRINCIPLES OF [[THE UNITED NATIONS || 8]] AND [[THEIR ||3]] SUPPORT OF ACTIVITIES WHICH [[IT || 8]] PROMOTES. BUT SO LONG AS A GENERAL, COMPLETE AND CONTROLLED DISARMAMENT DOES NOT PERMIT THE RISK OF AGGRESSION TO BE ELIMINATED, [[THEY ||3]] BELIEVE THAT THE DEFENSIVE TIES WHICH UNITE [[THEM ||3]] MUST BE MAINTAINED AND THAT [[THEIR ||3]] SECURI- TY CANNOT BE DISREGARDED.


3. [[THEY ||3]] REITERATE, THEREFORE, [[THEIR ||3]] INTENT TO CONTINUE EXISTING COOPERATION--BASED ON FIRM FRIENDSHIP-- THROUGH RECIPROCAL SUPPORT OF [[THEIR ||3]] DEFENSIVE EFFORTS IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN [[THEIR ||3]] OWN SECURITY AND WITH IT THE SECURITY OF THE FREE WORLD.


4.  [[THEY ||3]] CONFIRM, THAT IN FACT, FOR OVER 20 YEARS  [[THEIR ||3]] COOPERATION HAS STRENGTHENED  [[THEIR ||3]] OWN SECURITY AND THAT OF THE [[ATLANTIC AREA ||5]], THUS HELPING TO PRESERVE THE VALUES, IDEALS AND ASPIRATIONS BASED ON THE DIGNITY AND FREEDOM OF THE INDIVIDUAL.


5.  [[THEY ||3]] AFFIRM THAT SOVEREIGN EQUALITY, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY, POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE, THE RIGHT TO GOVERN THEMSELVES FREELY AND TO ATTAIN  [[THEIR ||3]] WELL BEING ARE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES WHICH [[BOTH COUNTRIES || 3]] WILL SCRU- PULOUSLY RESPECT.  [[THEY ||3]] BELIEVE THAT  [[THEIR ||3]] [[MUTUAL ||3]] DEFENSE EFFORT IS COMPLEMENTARY TO THAT OF EXISTING SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS IN THE [[ATLANTIC || 5]] FRAMEWORK AND THAT EQUAL TREATMENT SHOULD BE ACCORDED TO ALL THE COUNTRIES OF [[THE REGION ||5]]. ACCORDINGLY,  [[THEY ||3]] INTEND THAT  [[THEIR ||3]] DEFENSE COOPERATION BE COORDINATED WITH EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DEFENSE OF [[THE NORTH ATLANTIC AREA || 9]] INCLUDING [[THE MEDITERRANEAN ||6]], BEING CONVINCED THAT RECIPROCAL SECURITY AND INTEGRITY ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF PEACE AND THAT THE SECURITY OF [[THE ATLANTIC || 5]] AND [[MEDITERRANEAN ||6]] AREA REQUIRES THE EFFORT OF ALL CONCERNED.


6. [[THE TWO GOVERNMENTS || 3]] RECOGNIZE THAT THE SECURITY AND INTEGRITY OF BOTH [[THE UNITED STATES || 10]] AND [[SPAIN || 11]] ARE NECESSARY FOR THE COMMON SECURITY.  [[THEY ||3]] REAFFIRM, THEREFORE, THAT A THREAT TO OR AN ATTACK ON [[EITHER COUNTRY || 3]] WOULD BE A MATTER OF CONCERN TO [[BOTH ||4]] AND [[EACH COUNTRY ||3]] WOULD TAKE SUCH ACTION AS IT MAY CONSIDER APPRO- PRIATE WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF ITS CONSTITUTIONAL PROCES- SES. WITH THIS IN MIND, [[THEY ||3]] WILL CONTINUE TO CONSOLI- DATE  [[THEIR ||3]] DEFENSE COOPERATION BY MEANS OF CLOSE AND FREQUENT CONSULTATIONS IN ORDER TO INSURE EFFECTIVENESS IN  [[THEIR ||3]] EFFORT.


7. AWARE THAT COOPERATION SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN ALL FIELDS, [[THEY ||3]]  BELIEVE THAT HARMONIOUS POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RELATIONS CONSTITUTE VALUABLE SUPPORT FOR SE- CURITY, INSOFAR AS THEY PERMIT  [[EACH COUNTRY ||3]] TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRESS OF THE OTHER. TO THIS END [[BOTH GOVERNMENTS ||3]] WILL ENDEAVOR TO AVOID CONFLICTS BETWEEN  [[THEIR ||3]] RESPECTIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES AND TO ELIMINATE ANY OBSTACLES WHICH MAY ARISE IN THE WAY OF  [[THEIR ||3]] COLLABORA- TION. [[THEY ||3]]  WILL ADVANCE  [[THEIR ||3]] ECONOMIC, TECHNICAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION BY ALL MEANS AND IS NOT ONLY FOR  [[THEIR ||3]] OWN BENEFIT BUT ALSO FOR THAT OF THE DEVELO- PING COUNTRIES. SIMILARLY, GUIDED BY  [[THEIR ||3]] PERMANENT FRIENDSHIP AND FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF COMMON OBJECTIVES, [[THEY ||3]]  WILL CONTINUE TO CONSULT FREQUENTLY AT ALL APPRO- PRIATE LEVELS ON ALL MATTERS OF COMMON INTEREST.


8. [[THEY ||3]]  RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ATTAINTMENT OF THE IDEALS OF PROGRESS, SOCIAL JUSTICE AND WELL BEING BY EVERY NATION ESPECIALLY BY THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF WORLD PEACE AND [[THEY ||3]]  REITERATE  [[THEIR ||3]] WILL TO CONTRIBUTE IN DECISIVE MANNER TO THE PROMOTION OF THESE OBJECTIVES. FINALLY, [[THEY ||3]]  DECLARE THAT THE FRIENDLY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN [[SPAIN || 11]] AND [[THE UNITED STATES || 10]] WILL NOT BE DIRECTED AGAINST ANY COUNTRY BUT WILL HAVE AS ITS PURPOSE TO PRESERVE THE INDEPENDENCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE WELFARE OF  [[THEIR ||3]] PEOPLES. DESIRING THAT  [[THEIR ||3]] COMMON EFFORT CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO WORLD PEACE AND THE PROGRESS OF HUMANITY."
