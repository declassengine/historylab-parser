1. SUMMARY: [[[[SITHOLE || 1]] REP, DR. GOPO || 2]] SHOWED NO INTEREST IN THE PROPOSED CONFERENCE AND DELIVERED A MESSAGE FROM [[SITHOLE || 1]] THAT THE INTERNAL AGREEMENT WAS IRREVERSIBLE. END SUMMARY.


2. [[GRAHAM || 3]] PARTY WITH [[EMB || 4]] POLITICAL COUNSELOR PRESENT MET WITH [[DR. GOPO || 2]] AT [[BRITISH EMB || 4]] ON MARCH 18. AFTER [[GRAHAM || 3]] EXPLAINED THE PROPOSAL FOR A MEETING OF ALL THE PARTIES, [[DR. GOPO || 2]] SAID [[HE || 2]] HAD BEEN PROVIDED AN "ADVANCE ANSWER" BY [[SITHOLE || 1]]. [[SITHOLE || 1]], [[DR. GOPO || 2]] SAID, WISHED TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE [[SALISBURY || 5]] AGREEMENT WAS "SEALED AND IRREVERSIBLE". [[THE PATRIOTIC FRONT || 6]] HAS EXCLUDED [[ITSELF|| 6]]; BUT [[IT|| 6]] IS STILL WELCOME TO COME. "WHAT [[WE   || 19]] WANT," [[DR. GOPO || 2]] SAID, " IS FOR [[THE US || 7]] AND [[UK || 8]] TO TELL [[US || 19]] WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE [[SALISBURY || 5]] AGREEMENT RATHER THAN TO SEEK ANOTHER CONFERENCE TO APPEASE [[THE PATRIOTIC FRONT || 6]]". [[GOPO || 2]] CONCEDED THAT [[THE PATRIOTIC FRONT || 6]] HAD MADE VICTORY POSSIBLE OVER [[SMITH || 9]] BUT SAID THAT [[IT|| 6]] SHOULD NOT TRY TO DICTATE. THE REALITY IN [[AFRICA || 14]], [[HE || 2]] SAID, IS THAT IF YOU GIVE SOMEONE CONTROL OF THE GUN HE WILL RULE.


3. [[GRAHAM || 3]] EMPHASIZED THAT [[WE ||17]] WERE SEEKING FOR WAYS TO DETERMINE THE FREE CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE. IT WAS INDISPUTABLE THAT [[THE PATRIOTIC FRONT|| 6]] HAD SOME SUPPORT AND THAT THE FIGHTING WAS CONTINUING. [[WE ||17]] WERE NOT APPEASING [[THE PATRIOTIC FRONT|| 6]] NOR DID [[IT|| 6]]  HAVE A VETO, [[GRAHAM || 3]] SAID, BUT IT WAS PRACTICAL POLITICS TO TRY TO FIND A REASONABLE FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE FOR [[THEIR||6]] PARTICIPATION IN A FREE ELECTION.


4. [[GOPO || 2]] SAID THAT [[SITHOLE || 1]] SEES THE [[ANGLO || 8]]-[[AMERICAN || 7]] EFFORTS AND [[THE SECURITY COUNCIL  || 10]] RESOLUTION AS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO [[NKOMO || 15]] AND [[MUGABE || 16]] AND AS CREATING THE SITUATION FOR CIVIL WAR. [[GOPO || 2]] COMPLAINED THAT [[THE UN || 11]], [[UK || 8]] AND [[US || 7]] HAD ALL CONDEMNED THE INTERNAL AGREEMENT WITHOUT TAKING TIME TO ASSESS ITS ACCEPTABILITY.


5. AT THE PRESENT, [[GOPO || 2]] SAID, "[[WE ||19]] ARE PREOCCUPIED WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE [[SALISBURY ||5]] AGREEMENT, CRISS- CROSSING [[THE COUNTRY || 5]]. CONTACTING ALL RACES, ASSESSING REACTION AND EXPLAINING THE AGREEMENT TO SEE IF IT IS ACCEPTABLE". AFTER FORMATION OF [[THE TRANSITIONAL GOVT || 12]], [[GOPO || 2]]  ASSERTED, [[SITHOLE || 1]] WILL GIVE THE ORDER TO [[ZANLA FORCES || 13]] TO CEASE FIRE. [[GOPO || 2]] HAD NO DOUBT THT A CEASE FIRE WITH [[ZANLA FORCES || 13]]  WITHIN [[RHODESIA ||5]] WOULD TAKE PLACE WITHIN A FEW WEEKS, ALTHOUGH [[HE || 2]] SAID THERE WAS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN CEASE FIRE AND DISARMING AS THE LATTER WOULD TAKE SOME TIME TO ACCOMPLISH. [[THEIR ||19]]  TENTATIVE ASSESSMENT, [[GOPO || 2]] SAID, IS THAT THE PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE GURRILLAS INSIDE [[THE COUNTRY ||5]], ARE "WHOLE-HEARTEDLY" IN FAVOR OF THE  [[SALISBURY ||5]] AGREEMENT. AS EVIDENCE, [[HE || 2]] POINTED TO A RECENT RALLY FOR [[SITHOLE || 1]] AT [[UMTALLE ||5]] WHERE 25,000 PEOPLE REPORTEDLY GREETED NEWS OF THE AGREEMENT. GUERRILLAS IN THE RURAL AREAS, [[GOPO || 2]] ASSERTED, HAD PUT UP POSTERS URGING PEOPLE TO GO TO THE RALLY.


6. [[GOPO || 2]] SAID THAT WHILE [[ZANLA GUERRILLAS || 13]] WOULD SOON LAY DOWN [[THEIR ||13]] ARMS ([[HE || 2]] DID NOT REFER TO [[ZAPU FORCES|| 18]]), SOME SKIRMISHES WOULD CONTINUE. BUT "[[WE'RE || 19]] WILLING TO DEFEND WITH OUR OWN BLOOD WHAT [[WE ||19]] DECIDE", [[HE||2]] SAID. [[GOPO || 2]] CLAIMED THERE ARE "INDICATIONS" THAT "THOUSANDS OF DETAINEES" WILL SOON BE FREE AND THAT PROTECTED VILLAGES WILL BE DISMANTLED. [[GOPO || 2]] AGREED THAT [[SMITH ||9]] AT ANY TIME COULD FALL BACK ON THE AGREEMENT BUT ASSERTED THAT [[THEY ||19]] BELIEVE THIS TIME [[SMITH ||9]] IS SERIOUS. ASKED HOW THE CONDUCT OF THE WAR WOULD BE MANAGED, [[GOPO || 2]] SAID THAT [[HE || 2]] UNDERSTOOD A MILITARY TRIBUNAL COMPOSED OF [[ZANLA|| 13]] AND [[RDF LEADERS || 20]] MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED BUT THIS HAD NOT YET BEEN WORKED OUT.


7. WHEN [[GRAHAM ||3]] UNDERSCORED THE DANGERS INVOLVED IN SUCH EXERCISES AS THE RECENT [[RHODESIAN || 5]] RAID INTO [[ZAMBIA || 21]] , [[GOPO || 2]] AT FIRST RESPONDED THAT [[HE ||2]] PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE RAID REPEATED. UNDER CRITICISM [[HE ||2]] BACKED DOWN AND SAID "SPEAKING SERIOUSLY", [[HE ||2]] WOULD NOT LIKE TO SEE FORCE USED AGAINST "[[OUR || 5]] CHILDREN" IN THE MILITARY CAMPS IN [[ZAMBIA || 21]] AND [[MOZAMBIQUE || 22]].
