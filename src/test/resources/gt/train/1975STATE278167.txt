1. [[MISSION || 1]] IS REQUESTED TO MAKE IMMEDIATE REPRESENTATIONS TO [[EC COMMISSION|| 2]] EXPRESSING [[USG|| 3]]  CONCERN OVER [[COMMUNITY'S|| 4]]  EXPORT SUBSIDIES FOR FRESH APPLES.




2. THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RAISED WITH [[EC OFFICIALS|| 5]]  ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BUT TO NO AVAIL. [[US|| 3]]  MOST RECENT REPRESENTATION ON THIS SUBJECT WAS BY [[MISSION OFFICIAL|| 1]]  TO [[COMMISSION'S [[ U.S. || 3 ]] DESK OFFICER|| 6]] ON DECEMBER 13, 1974 (REFTEL). ISSUE ALSO RAISED IN [[US|| 3]] -[[EC|| 4]]  CONSULTATIONS OF DECEMBER 5-6, 1974 IN [[WASHINGTON|| 7]]  WHEN [[[[EC|| 4]]  REPRESENTATIVE (RABOT) || 8]]  PROMISED TO LOOK INTO SITUATION.




3. THE RECENT ISSUANCE OF [[EC|| 4]]  REGULATION 2791/75 AGGRAVATES AN ALREADY SERIOUS SITUATION. THIS REGULATION INCREASED THE SUBSIDY RATE APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN [[AFRICAN COUNTRIES|| 9]], [[THE ARABIAN PENINSULA || 10]] AND [[IRAN || 11]] , FROM 3 UNITS TO 10 UNITS OF ACCOUNT PER 100 KG., A MORE THAN THREE FOLD INCREASE. RATE APPLICABLE TO SELECTED MARKETS IN [[NORTHERN EUROPE || 12]] AND [[LATIN AMERICA || 13]] WAS INCREASED FROM 3 TO 5 U.A. PER 100 KG. THESE INCREASES BECAME EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 29.




4. [[USG|| 3]] IS AWARE OF [[EC’S|| 4]] PROBLEMS IN HANDLING HUGE 1975 APPLE CROP. HOWEVER, [[EC|| 4]] SHOULD ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT [[US || 14]] FACES RECORD APPLE CROP, WITH GROWERS IN SOME AREAS HARVESTING ONLY PART OF THEIR CROPS AND FACING LOSSES THIS SEASON. TRADITIONAL MARKETS IN BOTH [[NORTHERN EUROPE || 12]] AND [[LATIN AMERICA || 13]] ARE OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO [[U.S. || 14]] APPLY INDUSTRY. RECENT REPORT FROM [[NEW YORK || 14]] EXPORTER INDICATED THAT A PROSPECTIVE SALE OF 4,400 BUSHELS TO [[NORTHERN EUROPEAN ||12]] MARKET WAS JUST CANCELLED SOLELY BECAUSE OF THE [[EC|| 4]]  SUBSIDY. MORE CANCELLATIONS ARE ANTICIPATED FOR SAME REASON. MAGNITUDE OF [[EC|| 4]] SUBSIDY TO [[ARABIAN PENINSULA  || 10]] AND [[IRAN || 11]] REMOVES ANY POSSIBILITY OF [[U.S. || 14]] PARTICIPATION IN THAT MARKET AREA.




5. FYI. A NUMBER OF [[U.S. || 14]] GROWER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE REGISTERED SERIOUS CONCERN OVER [[EC|| 4]] SUBSIDY. UNLESS SUBSIDY IS REMOVED, SUCH CONCERN COULD LEAD TO SECTION 301 PETITION. END FYI. 




6. [[USG|| 3]] URGES [[EC|| 4]] TO CONSIDER COMPLETE REMOVAL OFAPPLE SUBSIDY.
