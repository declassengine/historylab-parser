1. [[EMBOFF || 1]] DISCUSSED PORT CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WITH [[[[TURKISH || 3]] EMBASSY CHARGE || 2]] AUGUST 16. ([[TURKISH || 3]]  ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN MAJOR EXPANSION PROGRAM FOR [[TRIPOLI || 5]] PORT.) [[TURKISH EMBASSY ||2]] UNABLE TO SHED ANY LIGHT ON [[[[LIBYAN || 4]] ARAB NAVY'S || 6]] POSSIBLE USE OF SUBMARINE NETS FOR PORT USE. [[TURKS || 3]] POINT OUT THAT ALL HARBOR CONSTRUCTION/MAINTENANCE IS RESPONSIBITY OF [[DIRECTORATE OF PORTS AND LIGHTS || 9]], NOT REPEAT NOT  [[ THE [[LIBYAN || 4]] ARAB NAVY || 6]].


2. WHILE [[WE || 1]] ARE NOT TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED COMMENT ON LIKELY USE OF SUBMARINE NETS AS ROAD CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL, [[WE || 1]]  CAN CONFIDENTLY REPORT THAT  [[[LIBYAN || 4]] ARAB NAVY || 6]] IS NOT REPEAT NOT ENGAGED IN ANY ROAD BUILDING PROJECTS AT THIS TIME. [[EMBASSY ||1]] COULD ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN APPOINTMENT THROUGH [[MFA || 11]] WITH [[MILITARY PROCUREMENT OFFICE ||10]]  WHERE, [[WE || 1]]  BELIEVE, CONTRACT FOR SUBMARINE NETS WAS MADE. HOWEVER, [[WE || 1]]  DO NOT RECOMMEND IT.


3. SUGGEST [[DEPARTMENT ||7]] CONSULT WITH EXPORTER. BELIEVE THERE CONSIDERABLE DOUBT AS TO NON-MILITARY PURPOSE TO WHICH [[LIBYANS ||4]] WILL PUT THESE SUBMARINE NETS. BURDEN OF PROOF SHOULD, IN THIS CASE, REST WITH EXPORTER AND CONFIGNEE. [[WE || 1]]  LOOK FORWARD WITH INTEREST TO THE EXPLANATIONS WHICH WILL BE OFFERED BY THE EXPORTER AND [[ THE [[LIBYAN || 4]] ARAB NAVY || 6]].
