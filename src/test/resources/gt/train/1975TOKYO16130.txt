1. ACCORDING TO FIGURES RELEASED BY 


[[STATISTICS BUREAU OF [[ PRIMIN'S || 1]] OFFICE  || 2]]


ON NOV 7, NUMBER OF [[JAPANESE||4]] UNEMPLOYED TOTALED 990,000 IN SEPT, AN INCREASE OF 50,000 FROM AUG. SEASONALLY ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE FOR SEPT REACHED 1.93 PERCENT, THE HIGHEST SINCE NOV 1959. NUMBER OF WORKERS EMPLOYED IN MANUFACTURING SECTOR, WHICH HAD SHOWN SLOW BUT STEADY UPTURN DURING SUMMER, AGAIN STARTED TO DECLINE IN SEPT.


2. IN RELEASING THE FIGURES, [[PRIMIN'S OFFICE|| 1 ]] SAID [[IT || 1]] EXPECTED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND NOTED THAT [[JAPANESE|| 4]] BUSINESS RECOVERY FROM CURRENT RECESSION SLOWER THAN EXPECTED.


3. COMMENT. OFFICIAL [[GOJ || 3]] UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES DO NOT FULLY REFLECT CURRENT LABOR MARKET CONDITIONS [[HERE || 4]]. ACCORDING TO UNOFFICIAL FIGURES OF [[MINISTRY OF LABOR || 6]], IN AUG 1975 APPROXIMATELY 300,000 WORKERS WERE PLACED IN A "TEMPORARY LEAVE STATUS" BY THEIR COMPANIES BUT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE SPECIAL PAYMENT UNDER NEW EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE LAW ENACTED IN JAN 1975. IN ADDITION, MANY WOMEN WORKERS HAVE BEEN LAID OFF BUT DO NOT APPLY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND INSTEAD WITHDRAW FROM LABOR FORCE. 
[[JAPANESE|| 4]] LABOR UNIONS, THEREFORE, CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT UNEMPLOYMET SITUATION IN [[JAPAN || 4]] IS MORE SERIOUS THAN [[GOJ || 3]] FIGURES WOULD HAVE PUBLIC BELIEVE. NEVERTHELESS, WHILE UNEMPLOYMENT IS MUCH TALKED ABOUT IN MEDIA, IT IS NOT YET SERIOUS POLITICAL ISSUE IN [[JAPAN || 4]].
