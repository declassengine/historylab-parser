1. THE FOLLOWING IS THE FULL TEXT OF [[SECRETARY OF STATE VANCE'S || 1]] SPEECH TO [[THE UNITED NATIONS || 2]] PLEDGING CONFERENCE FOR EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN RELIEF TO [[THE PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA || 3]], NOVEMBER 5, 1979.


2. BEGIN TEXT: "[[MR. SECRETARY GENERAL || 4]], LET [[ME || 1]] THANK [[YOU ||4]] FOR [[YOUR ||4]] INITIATIVE IN CALLING THIS CONFERENCE, AND [[YOUR ||4]] LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS. [[I|| 1]] WILL BE BRIEF. FOR [[WE || 2]] ARE HERE, TODAY, TO ACT. [[WE ||2]] ARE HERE TO MAKE, THROUGH [[OUR ||2]] INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS, AN INTERNATIONAL COMMITMENT TO DEAL WITH A HUMAN TRAGEDY OF ALMOST UNFATHOMABLE PROPORTIONS.
[[WE || 2]] NEED NO OTHER CALL TO ACTION THAN THE GRIM FACTS IN [[KAMPUCHEA || 3]].
--[[A NATION OF SEVEN MILLION  || 3]] HAS BEEN RAVAGED BY FAMINE AND DISEASE, BRUTALITY AND WAR. SOME TWO MILLION HAVE PERISHED.
--DEATH HAS STRUCK HARDEST AT THE CHILDREN. AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF [[KAMPUCHEANS || 5]] MAY HAVE BEEN LOST.
--THE MEAGER FOOD AVAILABLE HAS BECOME A BOOTY OF WAR.
--MALARIA IS RAMPANT. ANTHRAX HAS APPEARED. MINIMAL HEALTH CARE IS VIRTUALLY NON-EXISTENT.
EVEN THESE ARE ONLY FRAGMENTS OF THE TRAGEDY. STATISTICS ARE ONLY A SHADOW OF THE REALITY.
THE REALITY OF [[KAMPUCHEA || 3]]...OF A PEOPLE ON THE VERGE OF EXTINCTION...IS MOST POWERFULLY CONVEYED BY THE IMAGES OF SUFFERING CARRIED IN OUR DAILY NEWSPAPERS. THE SILENT GRIEF OF A YOUNG [[KHMER || 6]] MOTHER CRADLING HER DEAD BABY IN HER ARMS, A VICTIM OF STARVATION...OR THE VACANT GAZE OF AN INFANT BEYOND HELP AND HOPE IN A MAKESHIFT ORPHANAGE IN [[PHNOM PENH || 3]].
[[WE || 2]] ARE HERE AS DIPLOMATS...AS REPRESENTATIVES OF [[OUR|| 2]] GOVERNMENTS...TO ADDRESS THIS REALITY. BUT FIRST OF ALL, [[WE || 2]] ARE HERE AS HUMAN BEINGS. [[OUR||2]] PRESENCE REFLECTS THE CONCERN OF MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS IN ALL [[OUR||2]] NATIONS WHO CARE ABOUT THIS SUFFERING. SOME ISSUES TRANSCEND POLITICS. THIS IS ONE OF THEM.
CLEARLY, THERE ARE DIFFERENCES AMONG GOVERNMENTS ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION IN [[KAMPUCHEA || 3]]. BUT [[ALL OF US||2]] MUST PUT THOSE DIFFERENCES ASIDE...AS [[WE || 2]] ASK ALL [[THE AUTHORITIES || 7]] INVOLVED IN [[KAMPUCHEA || 3]] TO TURN AWAY FROM CALCULATIONS OF POLITICAL AND MILITARY ADVANTAGE...AND TURN TO THE OVER- WHELMING HUMAN ISSUE BEFORE [[US||2]].
IN THIS CONNECTION, [[I ||1]] WANT TO SINGLE OUT [[THE GOVERNMENT OF THAILAND || 8]] FOR [[ITS|| 8]] COURAGEOUS AND CORRECT DECISION TO ALLOW INTO [[ITS || 8]] [[COUNTRY || 9]] LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE FLEEING FAMINE AND DISEASE. THE BURDEN THIS PLACES ON [[THE THAI GOVERNMENT ||8 ]] IS IMMENSE, AND [[WE||2]] IN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY OWE [[THAILAND || 8]] NOT ONLY [[OUR||2]] ADMIRATION BUT ALSO  [[OUR||2]] FULL SUPPORT. SO LET [[US||2]] GET TO THE BUSINESS AT HAND. [[MR. SECRETARY GENERAL || 4]],[[ I ||1]] AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF [[THE PRESIDENT OF [[THE UNITED STATES ||11 ]] || 10]] TO PLACE SUBSTANTIAL MATERIAL RESOURCES BEHIND A MAJOR HUMANITARIAN EFFORT.
--[[PRESIDENT CARTER || 10]] HAS COMMITTED [[THE UNITED STATES|| 11]] TO A CONTRIBUTION DURING THE NEXT SIX MONTHS OF $30 MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL RELIEF EFFORTS IN [[KAMPUCHEA || 3]] AND $9 MILLION FOR [[KHMER||6]] WHO HAVE RECENTLY FLED TO [[THAILAND || 9]].
--[[[[OUR || 11]] CONGRESS ||12 ]] IS APPROVING $30 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THE NEXT PHASE OF RELIEF EFFORTS. THIS IS IN ADDITION TO OUR ALREADY SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE REFUGEE PROGRAM IN THE SAME AREA.
--AND [[WE || 11]] WILL GIVE [[OUR || 11]] FULL SUPPORT, IN ANY WAY THAT WILL BE HELPFUL, TO THE EFFORTS OF [[THE UNITED NATIONS ||2]]...[[UNICEF ||13]] AND [[THE ICRC ||14]]...AND PRIVATE VOLUNTARY GROUPS...AS THEY CONTINUE THE ENORMOUS TASK THEY HAVE NOW BEGUN.
[[WE || 2]] MUST PURSUE EVERY AVENUE...AND USE EVERY MEANS...TO BRING RELIEF SUPPLIES TO PEOPLE DESPERATELY IN NEED. WHETHER THROUGH [[THAILAND ||9]], THROUGH [[VIETNAM || 15]] OR BY SEA... WHETHER BY TRUCK, AS [[WE ||11]] HAVE RECENTLY URGED...BY AIRLIFT... OR BY RIVER TRANSPDRT...FOOD AND MEDICINE, IN SUFFICIENT NOTE BY OC/T: NOT PASSED TO ALL DIPLOMATIC POSTS.
