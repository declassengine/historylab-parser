1. ON THURSDAY [[THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY || 1]] WILL DECIDE ON THE SITE FOR THE CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. [[I || 2]] NEED [[YOUR||3]] DECISION ON WHETHER TO TAKE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT [[UN MEMBERS || 4]] CAN CHOOSE THE [[U.S.||5 ]] IF [[THEY || 4]] SO DESIRE. THIS WOULD REQUIRE [[US|| 9]] TO INTRODUCE A RESOLUTION.


2. THE PROCEDURAL SITUATION IS AS FOLLOWS:
--ON THURSDAY MORNING, [[AUSTRIA || 7]], WHICH HAS INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION ON [[ITS || 7]] OWN BEHALF, WILL ASK FOR A SECRET BALLOT.
--[[MEXICO || 8]] , WHICH HAS INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION ASKING THAT THE SITE BE IN A "DEVELOPING COUNTRY", WILL CHALLENGE THE [[AUSTRIAN || 7]] MOTION.
--IF THE [[MEXICAN || 8]] CHALLENGE IS SUCCESSFUL, THEN THERE WILL BE AN OPEN VOTE ON THE TWO RESOLU- TIONS, WITH THE [[AUSTRIAN|| 7]] RESOLUTION VOTED UPON FIRST. IF THE [[AUSTRIAN|| 7]] RESOLUTION FAILS, THEN THE NEXT RESOLUTION WILL BE VOTED UPON.
--IF THE [[MEXICAN || 8]] CHALLENGE FAILS, THEN [[THE MEMBER- SHIP ||1]] WILL BE ASKED TO VOTE, IN A SECRET BALLOT, BY INDICATING WHICH SITE EACH MEMBER PREFERS AMONG THOSE PROPOSED.
--IN ORDER FOR [[THE UNITED STATES ||5 ]] TO BE CONSIDERED, [[WE||9 ]] MUST INTRODUCE A RESOLUTION ON [[OUR||9]] OWN BEHALF PROMPTLY THURSDAY MORNING. IF [[WE||9]]  FAIL TO DO SO, [[WE||9]]  WILL BE PROCEDURALLY FORECLOSED FROM BEING CONSIDERED. (THERE IS A THEORETICAL OPTION OF [[OUR||9]] ASKING SOMEONE ELSE TO INTRODUCE A RESOLUTION ON [[OUR||9]]  BEHALF. [[I ||2]] BELIEVE IT WOULD BE UNDIGNIFIED FOR [[US||9]]  TO DO SO AND WOULD BE UNDERSTOOD BY [[THE MEM- BERSHIP||1]]  AS BEING AN ARTIFICIAL AND DEVIOUS MANEUVER.)


3. [[WE ||6]] ARE PRESENTLY OPERATING UNDER [[YOUR ||3]] INSTRUCTIONS TO CONDUCT [[OURSELVES||6]] SO AS NOT TO BRING ABOUT A CONFRONTATION WITH [[MEXICO || 8]] AND NOT TO HAVE [[OUR ||9]] CANDIDACY, WHICH IS A MATTER OR RECORD, BECOME A BURDEN IN [[OUR ||9]] BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH [[MEXICO || 8]]. [[WE||6]] HAVE BEEN SCRUPULOUS IN [[OUR||9]] DIPLOMACY HERE; [[WE||6]] HAVE TWISTED NO ARMS; [[WE||6]] HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH [[MEXICO || 8]], AND [[WE||6]] HAVE BEEN FOREMOST IN URGING A DECISION BY CONSENSUS RATHER THAN BY CHOICE AMONG COMPETING CAN- DIDACIES.


4. [[I||2]] AM CLEAR IN [[MY||2]] OWN MIND THAT [[WE||6]] HAVE NOT BURDENED [[OUR || 9]] BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH [[MEXICO || 8]]. IN FACT, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS [[MEXICAN REPRESENTATIVES  || 8]] HERE HAVE ASKED [[US ||6]] TO PUT FORWARD [[OUR||6]] OWN RESOLUTION. THE [[[[MEXICAN || 8]] PERMANENT REP- RESENTATIVE || 10]] HERE, [[[[ITS || 8]] AMBASSADOR TO [[ECOSOC || 11]] || 12]], AND [[[[ITS || 8]] SCIENCE ATTACHE ||13]] (WHO IS MANAGING THE ITEM FOR [[MEXICO || 8]] IN [[THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY|| 1]]) ALL HAVE JOINED IN ASKING [[US ||6 ]] TO DO SO. [I||2]] CANNOT DEFINITIVELY INTERPRET [[THEIR|| 8]]  MOTIVES. [[MY ||2]] STAFF BELIEVES THE  [[MEXICANS  || 8]] RECOGNIZE THAT [[THEY|| 8]]  WILL LOSE TO [[ASUTRIA||7]] AND RATHER THAN THAT, [[MEXICO || 8]] WOULD PREFER TO SEE THE CONFERENCE IN [[THE UNITED STATES|| 5]].


5. ACTING ON [[YOUR ||3]] STANDING INSTRUCTIONS, [[THE DEPARTMENT||3]] MAINTAINS THE POSITION THAT [[WE||6]] SHOULD NOT INTRODUCE A RESOLUTION ON [[OUR||9 ]] BEHALF. ASIDE FROM WHETHER [[WE|| 9]] IN THE END WANT THE CONFERENCE OR NOT, [[I ||2]] AM FRANKLY CONCERNED AT THE EFFECT ON [[OUR|| 9]] CREDIBILITY OF FIRST MAKING KNOWN [[OUR|| 9]] WILLINGNESS TO HOST A CONFERENCE YET AVOIDING THE FORTHRIGHT PROCEDURAL STEPS NEEDED TO ALLOW OTHERS TO DECIDE IN [[OUR|| 9]] FAVOR. [[I ||2]] ASK [[YOU|| 3]] TO RECONSIDER THE MATTER IN LIGHT OF THE MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.


[[YOUNG  ||2]]
