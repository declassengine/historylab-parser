[[KELLOGG || 1]], AND [[[[UNHCR || 3]] REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE VIRENDRA DAYAL || 2]], MAY 5, 1975
REF. 104022
SUMMARY



1. [[AMBASSADOR BROWN || 4]] MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS:
A. [[CONGRESS || 5]] CRITICAL OF [[UNHCR || 3]] PERFORMANCE TO DATE.
B. [[THE HCR ||3]] HAD MOVED FAR MORE SLOWLY THAN IN [[CYPRUS || 6]].
C. WHILE NOT PRESSING FOR AN INTERNATIONAL APPEAL, SOME PUBLICITY (E.G. THE [[HCR REPRESENTATIVES ||2]] ARRIVAL IN [[GUAM ||7]] ) WOULD BE HELPFUL.
D. [[THE HCR ||3]] SHOULD APPROACH SELECTED GOVERNMENTS REGARDING RESETTLEMENT EVEN IF REFUGEE NUMBERS ARE AMBIGUOUS.


2. [[DAYAL || 2]] MADE THE FOLLOWING POINTS:
A. [[THE HCR ||3]] HAD STRESSED IMPORTANCE OF NON-REFOULE- MENT FROM THE OUTSET.
B. [[CONGRESS || 5]] SHOULD APPRECIATE THAT THE PROBLEM IS WIDER THAN THE REFUGEES ON [[GUAM ||7]] AND THAT [[THE HCR ||3]] IS LOOKING AT THE TOTAL PICTURE.
C. [[THE [[UGANDAN|| 8]] ASIANS || 9]] REPRESENTED A PARALLEL PRO- BLEM WHERE [[THE UK || 11]] HAD TO ACCEPT THE MAJORITY OF THE REFUGEES BEFORE OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING [[THE U.S. || 12]]  WOULD TAKE THE REMAINDER.
D.  [[THE HCR ||3]]  UNDERSTANDS [[THE USG  || 12]] WOULD LIKE [[HIM ||2]] TO APPROACH SELECTED GOVERNMENTS BEFORE THE NUMBERS CLARIFY.
E. THAT [[HCR'S TEAM ||3]] WAS ARRIVING ON [[GUAM ||7]] MAY 6 AND WOULD START IDENTIFYING THOSE DESIRING TO GO TO 3RD COUNTRIES OR RETURN TO [[ VIET-NAM || 13]]. END SUMMARY


3. [[AMBASSADORS [[BROWN || 4]] AND [[BUFFUM || 15]] || 14]] WITH [[FRANK KELLOGG ||1]] MET [[[[UNHCR’S || 3]] REGIONAL REPRESENTATIVE VIRENDRA DAYAL || 2]]  ON MAY 5. THE MEETING WAS IN RESPONSE TO [[DAYAL'S || 2]] REQUEST FOLLOWING DELIVERY THE PREVIOUS DAY OF [[THE DEPARTMENT'S || 16]] MESSAGE TO THE [[SECRETARY GENERAL IN [[VIENNA || 17]] || 28]]  REGARDING [[THE HCR'S || 3]] ROLE IN THE [[INDO-CHINESE || 18]] REFUGEE CRISIS. [[AMBASSADOR BROWN || 4]] REPORTED [[HE|| 4]] HAD TESTIFIED BEFORE [[THE HOUSE JUDICIARY SUB- COMMITTEE || 19]] AND THAT [[ITS MEMBERS  || 19]] AND [[CONGRESS ||5]] IN GENERAL WERE EXERCISED OVER LACK OF ACTION ON PART OF [[UNHCR || 3]] AND [[ICEM || 32]] . DESPITE URGING BY THE [[USG ||12]], [[HE || 4]] SAID, [[UNHCR’S OFFICE || 3]]  HAD BEEN SLOW TO REACT AND THAT THIS MIGHT WELL HAVE A DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON FUTURE [[UNHCR || 3]] SUPPORT.


4. [[DAYAL ||2]]  ASSURED [[BROWN || 4]] OF [[UNHCR’S || 3]] FULL COOPERATION. WHEN THE SITUATION ERUPTED, [[UNHCR || 3]] IMMEDIATELY INSTRUCTED [[ITS FIELD REPRESENTATIVES || 3]] IN THE AREA TO PREVENT REFOULEMENT IN LIGHT OF GENERAL INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE AS NO [[ASIAN || 10]] COUNTRY IS SIGNATORY TO THE REFUGEE CONVENTION. THIS ACTION OCCURRED IN [[THAILAND || 20]] ([[BANGKOK|| 20]], [[UTAPAO|| 20]], AND BORDER AREAS WERE SPECIFICALLY CITED), [[SINGAPORE || 21]], [[MALAYSIA|| 22]], AND [[JAPAN|| 23]] WHERE [[DAYAL ||2]]   SAID, 800 STUDENTS HAD FACED POSSIBLE DEPORTATION. DESPITE A TENSE POLITICAL SITUATION THIS BASIC RESPONSIBILITY OF [[THE OFFICE ||3]]  HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY MET. 5. IN [[EUROPE || 24]] AND ELSEWHERE AROUND WORLD SIMILAR PRO- BLEMS HAD ARISEN, [[DAYAL ||2]]   REPORTED. INQUIRIES HAD BEEN RECEIVED ON THE PART OF [[CAMBODIANS || 26 ]] AND [[VIETNAMESE || 13]] IN [[FRANCE || 25]] AND OTHER COUNTRIES. EACH CASE HAD TO BE CON- SIDERED ON INDIVIDUAL MERITS NONE OF WHICH, [[DAYAL ||2]]   REMARKED, MAKES AN IMPRESSION ON THE [[U.S. CONGRESS || 5]]. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE FIRST PREOCCUPATION OF [[UNHCR || 3]] IS TO INSURE NON-REFOULEMENT; THE SECOND IS TO ATTEMPT TO SECURE AT LEAST TEMPORARY HAVEN IN THE HOST COUNTRY.


6. IN [[GUAM ||7]] [[DAYAL ||2]]   INDICATED THE [[HCR'S  REPRESENTATIVES ||3]] WOULD SEEK TO DETERMINE WHERE THE REFUGEES WISHED TO GO. THEN THE TASK WOULD BE TO PERSUADE COUNTRIES TO ACCEPT THEM. A FUNDAMENTAL DIFFICULTY FOR [[THE HCR ||3]], [[DAYAL ||2]]   SAID, WAS TO ESTABLISH THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PROBLEM. THE NUMBERS OF EX-[[SOUTH VIETNAMESE || 13]] CHANGED ALMOST DAILY. IT WAS, [[HE ||2]] FELT, ESSENTIAL TO APPROACH POTENTIAL RESETTLE- MENT COUNTRIES WITH FIRM FACTS AND FIGURES; A SECOND REQUEST WAS ALMOST ALWAYS UNSUCCESSFUL. AS YET, [[HE ||2]]  POINTED OUT, [[UNHCR || 3]] HAD LITTLE FEEL FOR THE RESIDUAL NUMBERS OF REFUGEES IN [[GUAM ||7]] . THE RANGE COULD VARY SUBSTANTIALLY AND [[THE HCR ||3]] TO BE CREDIBLE SHOULD BASE ANY DEMARCHE ON ESTABLISHED FACTS. FOR THIS REASON [[THE HCR ||3]] HAD NOT YET DETERMINED ON A PUBLIC APPEAL VS. A SELECTED TARGET APPROACH. [[HE|| 2]] HAD HOWEVER BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE [[CANADIAN GOVERNMENT || 27]] AND WAS ATTEMPTING TO IDENTIFY UP TO 15,000 [[VIETNAMESE || 13]] WITH LETTERS OF INTENT FROM [[THE GOC || 27]].


7. [[AMBASSADOR BROWN  || 4]] INTERJECTED THAT [[THE USG ||12]] HAD NOT WAITED TO ESTABLISH NUMBERS BUT HAD ACTED TO PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE. EVEN NOW NUMBERS HAVE YET TO BE ESTABLISHED. SURPRISED AT [[HCR'S||3]] DELAY AND FAILURE TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE AND DIRECT HELP WHICH IF NOT FORTHCOMING, WOULD BE A GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT. THERE MUST BE ACTION -- PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. [[CONGRESS || 5]], IN [[AMBASSADOR BROWN'S || 4]] UPCOMING HEAVY SCHEDULE OF HEARINGS, WOULD BE DEMANDING IT. A POLL OF 500 REFUGEES AT [[GUAM ||7]] INDICATED 10 DID NOT WISH TO GO TO [[THE U.S. || 29]] THESE NEED TO KNOW FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS WHERE THEY CAN MOVE. [[THE USG ||12]] HAS MADE A BILATERAL WORLDWIDE DEMARCHE TO GOVERNMENTS AND WILL SHARE RESPONSES WITH [[THE HCR ||3]].


8. [[DAYAL ||2]]   EMPHASIZED THAT [[ HCR ||3]] WAS NOT "COZYING UP TO [[THE COMMUNISTS"||30 ]] BUT FELT THAT THE VAST PROBLEM OF REUNITING FAMILIES IN THE COMING MONTHS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF [[SAIGON || 13]]  WARRANTED "KEEPING UP THESE CONVERSATIONS."[[THE HCR ||3]] WOULD HAVE TO RETAIN STAMINA FOR A LONG RESETTLE- MENT PROBLEM. IN RESPONSE TO [[AMBASSADOR BUFFUM'S || 15]] QUESTION [[THE HCR ||3]], [[DAYAL ||2]] BELIEVED, WOULD APPROACH GOVERNMENTS WITHOUT FURTHER DEFINITION OF NUMBERS TO ASCERTAIN "IN PRINCIPLE" THEIR RECEPTIVITY TO THE PROBLEM. [[HE||2]] ALSO EX- PLAINED THAT [[THE HCR ||3]] CUSTOMARILY OPERATED WITH A SMALL STAFF -- "IT IS THE NATURE OF [[OUR ||3]] OPERATION" -- BUT [[THEY ||3]] WILL STAY IN [[GUAM ||7]] AS LONG AS NECESSARY WITH APPROPRIATE VISIBILITY. [[DAYAL ||2]]   UNDERSTOOD THE SENSE OF URGENCY BOTH BECAUSE OF [[US ||29]] PUBLIC OPINION AND BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF TYPHOON SEASON. IT IS, [[HE ||2]] CONCLUDED, AN "INCREDIBLY DEMANDING JOB WITH WHICH [[UNHCR || 3]] IS FULLYSEIZED." 
[[KISSINGER || 31]]
