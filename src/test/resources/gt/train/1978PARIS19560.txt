(C) [[STATE || 34]] 141950



1. SUMMARY: LENGTHY [[COUNCIL || 1]] CONSIDERATION OF [[US ||2 ]] URBAN INITIATIVE DID NOT PRODUCE RESULT BECAUSE OF [[FRENCH || 3]] OPPOSITION, SUPPORTED BY [[GREECE || 4]], TO CREATION OF ANY NEW [[OECD || 5]] BODIES ON GROUNDS OF PROCEDURAL PRINCIPLE. OTHER COUNTRIES SUPPORTED [[U.S.|| 2]]  INITIATIVE AND [[SECRETARIAT || 6]] PAPER REF (A) WITH A FEW MINOR EXPRESSIONS OF CONCERN. STRONG SUPPORT FROM [[U.K. || 8]], [[NORWAY || 9]], [[CANADA || 10]], [[AUSTRALIA || 11]], [[NETHERLANDS || 12]], [[JAPAN ||13 ]], [[GERMANY || 14]], [[BELGIUM || 15]], [[SWEDEN || 16]], [[DENMARK || 17]], [[SPAIN || 18]], AND [[AUSTRIA || 19]]. [[SEC GEN || 20]] CONCLUDED THIS AGENDA ITEM IS TO BE TAKEN UP AGAIN BY [[COUNCIL || 1]] SOON AFTER MINIS- TERIAL MEETING. [[THE SECRETARY || 20]] HAS SINCE RAISED THE MATTER WITH [[[[FRENCH || 3]] FOREIGN MINISTER DE GUIRINGAUD || 21]] WHO SAID [[HE||21]] WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER. END SUMMARY.


2. [[U.S. REP || 2]] OPENED DISCUSSION WITH BRIEF REMARKS CITING (1) COMPLEXITY AND BREADTH OF URBAN PROBLEMS, (2) DESIRABILITY OF SHARING EXPERIENCE, AND (3) NEED FOR MECHANISM OF AD HOC GROUP TO DEFINE ISSUES AND WORK PROGRAM. [[DEPUTY SEC GEN ELDIN || 22]] FOLLOWED WITH DESCRIPTION OF [[OECD ||5]] EXPERIENCE AND RANGE OF CURRENT WORK INCLUDING PUBLIC SERVICES, CITY MANAQEMENT, TRANSPORTATION, POLLUTION, NOISE, USE OF DATA PROCESSING, ETC. [[HE || 22]] POINTED OUT THAT THIS WORK, ALTHOUOH USEFUL AND OF GOOD QUALITY, IS FRAQMENTED AND LACKS COHESION IN ECONOMIC POLICY SENSE THEREFORE IS OF LIMITED USEFULNESS TO GOVERNMENT DECISION MAKERS.  [[HE || 22]] EXPLAINED PROPOSED TWO-STAGE PROCEDURE OF USING AD HOC GROUP TO RECOMMEND SUBSTANCE, STRUCTURE AND FUNDING OF NEW PROGRAM, TO BE FOLLOWED BY IMPLEMENTATION BY [[COUNCIL ||1]] DECISION IN 1979. THE EXISTINQ [[URBAN ENVIRON- MENT GROUP ||25]] SHOULD NOT BE ENTRUSTED WITH THIS MANDATE SINCE AN [[OECD||5]] WIDE VIEWPOINT IS NEEDED TO DO THE JOB. THE AD HOC GROUP WILL COEXIST WITH [[THE URBAN ENVIRON- MENT GROUP ||25]] WITHOUT ANY CONFLICT. THERE WOULD BE NO BUDGETARY PROBLEM SINCE AD HOC GROUP WILL USE FUNDS ALREADY SET ASIDE FOR 1978. [[THE SECRETARY GENERAL || 20]] FULLY AGREES WITH THIS APPROACH AS RECOMMENDED BY [[U.S. ||2]], ACCORDING TO [[ELDIN|| 22]].


3. IN ENSUING DISCUSSION, STRONG AND UNQUALIFIED SUPPORT WAS EXPRESSED BY [[U.K. || 8]], [[NORWAY || 9]], [[CANADA || 10]], [[AUSTRALIA || 11]], [[NETHERLANDS || 12]], [[JAPAN ||13 ]], [[GERMANY || 14]], [[BELGIUM || 15]], [[SWEDEN || 16]], [[DENMARK || 17]], [[SPAIN || 18]], AND [[AUSTRIA || 19]]. [[FINLAND || 23]] APPROVED AD REFERENDUM. [[ITALY ||24]] PREFERRED BROADENING MANDATE OF [[URBAN ENVIRONMENT GROUP || 25]] BUT ACCEPTED MAJORITY OPINION. [[TURKEY ||26 ]] AGREED WITH SUBSTANCE BUT ASKED WHY JOB COULD NOT BE DONE IN [[ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE || 27]] AND SOUGHT TO LINK PROPOSAL TO SET UP AD HOC URBAN GROUP WITH ANOTHER PROPOSAL TO SET UP AD HOC GROUP ON MIGRATION. [[BELGIUM || 15]] AND  [[DENMARK || 17]] QUESTIONED [[THE SECRETARIAT'S || 6]] LIMITATION OF ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM EACH COUNTRY, CLAIMING THAT THE SUBJECT MATTER WAS TOO BROAD FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL TO COVER, CITING TOWN PLANNING, ENVIRONMENT, FINANCE AND MANAGEMENT AS NECESSARY ELEMENTS.


4. MAJOR PROBLEM HOWEVER WAS RAISED BY [[FRENCH AMBASSADOR BOEGNER || 28]] WHO STATED THAT [[HIS|| 28]] AUTHORITIES HAD CONSIDERED PROPOSAL WITH CARE AND FOUND IT USEFUL AND INTERESTING AS AN APPROACH TO A MAJOR PROBLEM. BUT THEY DIFFERED ON PROCEDURE, OPPOSING PROLIFERATION OF SPECIAL AD HOC GROUPS THAT WEAKENED RESPONSIBILITIES OF EXISTING BODIES OF THE ORGANIZATION. [[HE || 28]] SUGGESTED INSTEAD BROADENING MANDATE OF EXISTINQ [[URBAN ENVIRONMENT GROUP || 25]]

WHICH [[HE || 28]] SAID IS COMPETENT TO DO THE JOB AND BRING IN ADDITIONAL EXPERTS AS NEEDED. [[FRANCE ||3]]  [[HE || 28]] SAID DOES NOT AGREE WITH [[ELDIN’S || 22]] PRIOR COMMENT THAT AN EXISTINO GROUP WOULD TEND TO BE BIASED AND HAVE A NARROW VIEWPOINT. [[GREEK PERM DEL  || 4]] CHIMED IN TO SAY THAT NEW ORGANIZATIONS AND PEOPLE WERE UNNECESSARY WHEN EXISTING ORGANIZATION WAS AVAILABLE. MOREOVER, ONE REPRESENTATIVE PER COUNTRY WAS UNREALISTIC, IN [[HIS ||4]] VIEW, BECAUSE OF BREADTH OF URBAN OROBLEMS. [[DENMARK|| 17]]  SUOGESTED THAT AD HOC GROUP MEET BACK TO BACK WITH [[URBAN ENVIRONMENT GROUP || 25]] IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME AND TRAVEL OF PARTICIPANTS.


5. DCM INTERVENED TO EXPLAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DEFINITIONAL AND PLANNING JOB OF THE AD HOC GROUP AND THE SUBSTANTIVE WORK TO FOLLOW, SINCE THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME CONFUSION REFLECTED IN REMARKS OF DELEGATES AS TO WHAT AD HOC GROUP WOULD ACTUALLY DO. 


6. [[ELDIN|| 22]] THEN RESPONDED TO EXORESSIONS OF CONCERN:
(A) THERE ARE PERHAPS TOO MANY AD HOC GROUPS BUT THIS ONE IS A NECESSARY EXCEPTION, WILL EXIST FOR ONE YEAR AND WILL FILL A SPECIAL NEED.
(B) WE CANNOT ASK EXISTING GROUP TO DO THIS WORK IN ADDITION TO ITS REGULAR FUNCTION.
(C) IT WOULD BE TOO CUMBERSOME TO USE [[THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT GROUP || 25]] WHICH REPORTS THROUGH [[THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE || 27]] AND [[THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE|| 35]] TO [[THE COUNCIL ||1]].
(D) WE CANNOT ASK [[URBAN ENVIRONMENT GROUP || 25]]  TO ADOOT A BROADER VIEWPOINT THAN [[ITS|| 25]] OWN RESPONSIBILITY AND WE ALL AGREE THAT URBAN PROBLEMS ARE BIGGER THAN ENVIRONMENT ISSUES.
(E) THE PROPOSAL CONSTITUTES NO HAZARD TO [[THE ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE || 27]]  AND [[URBAN ENVIRONMENT GROUP || 25]]  AND IN FACT COULD RESULT IN A RECOMMENDATION FOR A LARGER ENVIRONMENT COMMITTEE ROLE IN URBAN PROBLEMS.


7. [[FRANCE|| 3]] AND [[GREECE||4]] MAINTAINED THEIR POSITIONS. [[THE SEC GEN || 20]] SUSPENDED THE DISCUSSION AND SUGGESTED RECONSIDERATION OF THE MATTER AT A FUTURE [[COUNCIL ||1]] MEETING, SOON AFTER THE MINISTERIAL.


8. COMMENT: DEBATE WAS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON PROCEDURAL ISSUE WITH LITTLE SUBSTANTIVE CONTENT. NO ONE APPARENTLY OPPOSES CENTRAL IDEA OF URBAN INITIATIVE. [[FRENCH ||3]] OPPOSITION IS BASED ON POSSIBLE MISUNDERSTANDING OF PURPOSE OF GROUP AND PERSONAL POSITION OF [[[[FRENCH || 3]] AMBASSADOR ||28]]. [[WE || 7]] HAVE ALSO HEARD REPORT THAT THERE MAY BE SOME BUREAUCRATIC CONFLICT IN [[FRENCH GOVERNMENT|| 3]]. [[THE SECRETARIAT ||6]] IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING WAYS OF ENDING THE IMPASSE. DURING A BILATERAL DISCUSSION ON THE OCCASION OF THE MINISTERIAL MEETING [[THE SECRETARY ||20]] RAISED THE MATTER WITH [[THE [[FRENCH ||3]]  FOREIQN MINISTER || 21]] WHO SAID [[HE|| 21]] WOULD LOOK INTO THE MATTER.
