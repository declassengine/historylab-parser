SUMMARY: IN CONVERSATION WITH [[AMB PETREE || 1]] ON [[U.S. || 2]] LETTER TO [[SC || 3]], [[[[YUGOSLAV  || 4]] POL COUNS  || 8]] ASKED FOR FIRM EVIDENCE OF BUILDUP ON [[KAMPUCHEAN/VIETNAM BORDER  || 5]] AND INDICATED [[HE  || 1]]THOUGHT [[THE NAM  || 9]] HAD AN OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO SUCH A PROBLEM. ACTION REQUESTED: THAT [[DEPT || 10]] PROVIDE DETAILED TALKING POINTS ON [[GDK/SRV BORDER || 5]] SITUATION. END SUMMARY.



1.  [[[[YUGOSLAV  || 4]] POL COUNS VUCOVICH || 8]] APPROACHED [[PETREE || 1]] NOV 2 TO ASK WHAT [[THE U.S. ||2]] SEEKS THROUGH [[ITS || 2]] LETTER TO [[THE SC  PRESIDENT ON [[KAMPUCHEA  || 6]] || 3]] . [[PETREE || 1]] SAID [[WE || 15]] DO NOT AT THIS STAGE SEEK A [[SC ||3]] MEETING, BUT [[WE||15]] BELIEVE THE [[KAMPUCHEAN ||6]] SITUATION IS SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS ON BOTH HUMAN RIGHTS AND SECURITY GROUNDS THAT THE [[UN || 11]] MUST TAKE IT UNDER CONSIDERATION IF THERE IS TO BE HOPE OF PREVENTING DETERIORATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. FURTHER- MORE, [[THE AMERICAN PEOPLE  || 12]] HAVE A STRONG CONCERN ABOUT BOTH HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND THE THREAT OF CONFLICT ACROSS [[THE BORDER || 5]]. [[WE ||15]] CONSEQUENTLY SOUGHT IN AN OPEN, FORTHRIGHT WAY ONLY TO STATE THE CONCERNS OF [[THE U.S. PEOPLE || 12]] AND [[GOVERNMENT || 2]] AND CALL ON THE COMMUNITY TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OF THE PROBLEMS.


2. [[VUCOVICH || 8]] ASKED WHETHER THERE IS FIRM EVIDENCE OF MILITARY BUILDUP AT [[THE BORDER || 5]], OR OTHER HARD EVIDENCE SUBSTANTIATING [[THE U.S. ||2]] WARNING OF SECURITY TROUBLE. [[PETREE || 1]] SAID THERE IS EVIDENCE, BUT FOR UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS [[HE|| 1]] IS NOT SURE WHAT MAY BE PROVIDED TO FRIENDS AT THIS STAGE. [[VUCOVICH || 8]] SAID [[HE||8]] WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SOME CONCRETE INFORMATION INDICATING THE SCOPE OF THE POTENTIAL PROBLEM. REFERRING TO [[NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT|| 9]] RESOLUTIONS PROMISING AN EVEN-HANDED CONCERN WITH THREATS TO THE PEACE AND SECURITY OF THE WORLD, [[VUCOVICH || 8]] SAID  [[HE||8]] PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO PUT TO  [[[[HIS||8]] GOVERNMENT || 4]] THE SUGGESTION THAT [[IT ||4]] AND [[THE NAM  || 9]] HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO RESPOND TO SUCH A PROBLEM. [[HE||8]] SUGGESTED THAT FACT-FINDING, GOOD-OFFICES AND OTHER KINDS OF MISSIONS TO PROBLEM AREAS WERE ENVISAGED IN A NUMBER OF [[NAM  || 9]] MEASURES.


3. COMMENT AND ACTION REQUESTED: IN CONVERSATION WITH [[USYG URQUHART || 13]] REPORTED SEPTEL, [[HE|| 13]] INDICATED IT WOULD NOW BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR [[SYG || 14]] TO ACCEPT [[U.S.||2]] BRIEFING ON [[THE BORDER ||5]] SITUATION BECAUSE OF [[SYG'S || 14]] SENSITIVITY TO CHARGES THAT [[HE || 14]] ACTED UNDER [[U.S. ||2]] PRESSURE IN ACCEPTING [[GDK || 19]] INVITATION. [[WE ||15]] BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE TALKING POINTS FOR USE WITH SELECTED DELEGATIONS HERE. TALKING POINTS SHOULD BE DETAILED ENOUGH TO PROVIDE CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF BUILDUP ON [[BORDER ||5]] AND SIGNS POINTING TO LIKELIHOOD OF INCREASED FIGHTING. [[DEPT ||10]] MAY WISH TO PROVIDE SEVERAL SETS OF TALKING POINTS DESIGNED FOR THE DIFFERENT DELEGATIONS WITH WHOM [[WE ||15]] WILL BE TALKING, SUCH AS [[OUR|| 2]] WESTERN ALLIES, [[JAPAN || 16]], [[ASEAN || 17]],  MEMBERS OF [[THE SYG'S STAFF ||14]] AND OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS [[YUGOSLAVIA || 4]]. [[WE ||15]] WOULD ALSO APPRECIATE [[DEPT'S || 10]] VIEWS ON POINT RAISED BY [[VUCOVICH || 8]] ON RELATIONSHIP TO [[NAM  || 9]] RESOLUTIONS AND POSSIBLE [[NAM  || 9]] RESPONSE TO [[BORDER ||5]] SITUATION.
