1. [[US || 1]] POSITION ON [[INDIAN OCEAN || 4]]  AS [[A ZONE OF PEACE || 4]] ([[IOZP || 4]] ) REMAINS THE SAME AS IN THE PAST YEARS AND [[MISSION || 5]] SHOULD ABSTAIN ON CURRENT [[IOZP || 4]] RESOLUTION. IN ADDITION TO REASONS [[WE || 3]] HAVE EXPRESSED IN THE PAST  [[WE || 3]] CANNOT SUPPORT CURRENT RESOLUTION'S CALL FOR A MEETING OF THE LITTORAL AND HINTERLAND STATES IN [[THE INDIAN OCEAN || 4]] AS THE NEXT STEP TOWARD CONVENING OF A CONFERENCE ON [[THE INDIAN OCEAN || 4]] .


2. TEXT OF EXPLANATION OF VOTE SETTING OUT [[US || 2]] POSITION WILL FOLLOW SEPTEL.


3. IN GENERAL [[WE || 3]]  PREFER THAT [[MISSION || 5]] ADOPT A LOW-KEY APPROACH ON THIS ISSUE. IF QUERIED CONCERNING [[US || 1]] VIEWS, [MISSION || 5]] SHOULD REPLY THAT [[OUR || 1]] POSITION REMAINS THE SAME AS IN THE PAST AND THAT [[WE || 1]]  ARE HOPEFUL ONGOING [[US-SOVIET || 6]] TALKS WILL LEAD TO MEANINGFUL STEPS TOWARDS AVOIDING A COMPETITIVE ARMS RACE IN THE REGION.


4. IN LIGHT OF [[AMBASSADOR ISRAELYAN'S || 7]] COMMENTS THAT [[THE USSR || 8]] IS READY TO ACCEPT THE IDEA OF AN [[INDIAN OCEAN || 4]] CONFERENCE BUT IS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT (REFTEL A), [[MISSION || 5]] SHOULD APPROACH SUMISSION AT AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL AND MAKE THE FOLLOWING POINTS:
- [[US || 1]] RECIPROCATES [[SOVIET ||8]] READINESS AS EXPRESSED BY [[AMBASSADOR ISRAELYAN || 7]] TO [[AMBASSADOR FISHER || 9]] TO COOPERATE ON [[IOZP || 4]] ISSUE;
- IN THAT REGARD [[WE || 5]] WISH TO INFORM [[SU ||8]] THAT [[US || 1]] INTENDS TO ABSTAIN ON THIS YEAR'S RESOLUTION.  [[US || 1]] DOES NOT SUPPORT THE CONVENING OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON THIS QUESTION WHICH [[WE || 1]]  THINK WOULD ONLY COMPLICATE [[US-SOVIET || 6]] TALKS ON [[INDIAN OCEAN || 4]] ARMS LIMITATIONS.
- IN [[OUR || 5]] VIEW, IF EITHER [[THE US || 1]] OR [[THE SU || 8]] WERE TO SUPPORT RESOLUTIONS CALLING FOR THE CONVENING OF SUCH A CONFERENCE THIS WOULD ONLY HEIGHTEN INTEREST IN THIS APPROACH AND COULD COMPLICATE [[OUR || 6]] ONGOING TALKS.
