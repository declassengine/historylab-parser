1. [[FRANGIE|| 1]]-[[ASAD|| 2]] SUMMIT THREATENED BY FIGHTING WHILE THE [[ASAD|| 2]]-[[FRANGIE|| 1]] MEETING HAS NOT BEEN CANCELLED, NO DATE HAS YET BEEN SET, AND IT APPEARS [[FRANGIE|| 1]] WILL INSIST ON A CEASEFIRE BEFORE GOING TO [[DAMASCUS|| 3]]. ANY CHANCE FOR AN EARLY END TO THE FIGHTING DETERIORATED IN THE LAST 24 HOURS, HOWEVER, DUE TO:
--SEVERE FIGHTING IN NEARLY ALL BATTLE ZONES;
--GROWING [[PALESTINIAN|| 4]] INVOLVEMENT IN ATTACKS ON RIGHT- IST BASTIONS; AND
--THE ATTACK BY [[[[LEBANESE || 5]] MILITARY || 6]] AIRCRAFT ON LEFTIST POSITIONS. (CONFIDENTIAL) [[BEIRUT|| 7]] 542, 1/16.)




2. COD WAR: [[BRITISH || 8]] PESSIMISTIC AN [[FCO || 9]] OFFICER HAS TOLD [[EMBASSY LONDON ||10 ]] THERE IS NO INDICA- TION THE [[LUNS|| 11]] TRIP TO [[ICELAND || 12]] PRODUCED ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD A SETTLEMENT. [[LUNS|| 11]] FLOATED [[THE UK'S|| 8]] OFFER TO WITHDRAW ALL [[BRITISH|| 8]] VESSELS FOR ONE WEEK IF [[ICELAND|| 13]] AGREES TO COMPRO- MISE BUT GOT NO RESPONSE. [[LUNS|| 11]] WILL BRIEF [[CALLAGHAN|| 14]] ON THE TRIP WHEN [[THEY|| 15]] MEET ON JANUARY 19. [[PRIME MINISTER HALLGRIMSSON|| 16]] MEANWHILE TOLD A PRESS CONFER- ENCE FOLLOWING [[LUNS' || 11]] DEPARTURE:
--[[LUNS|| 11]] IS CARRYING NO MESSAGE TO [[HMG|| 8]] FROM [[THE GOI|| 13]];
--AN UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWAL MUST TAKE PLACE, PROB- ABLY WITHIN A WEEK, IF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS ARE TO SURVIVE; AND,
--ONCE THIS IS DONE, NEW NEGOTIATIONS COULD TAKE PLACE, ALTHOUGH THE NEGOTIATING MARGIN IS VERY SMALL. (CONFIDENTIAL) [[LONDON|| 10]] 808 AND (UNCLASSIFIED) [[REYKJAVIK||18 ]] 93, 1/16.)




3. [[ITALY|| 19]]: INITIAL CONSULTATIONS PRODUCE NO RESULTS CONSULTATIONS BETWEEN [[PREMIER-DESIGNATE MORO || 20]] AND [[[[SOCIALIST ||22]] LEADER DEMARTINO|| 21]] ON JANUARY 15 PRODUCED NO VISIBLE MOVE- MENT TOWARD SETTLING THE [[GOVERNMENT|| 23]] CRISIS. THE [[SOCIALISTS|| 22]] ARE ADHERING TO [[THEIR|| 22]] DEMANDS ON THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM AND FOR "ASSOCIATION" OF [[THE COMMUNISTS || 24]] WITH [[THE GOVERNING MAJORITY|| 23]]. [[EMBASSY|| 25]] COMMENT: WHILE NOT ANXIOUS FOR EARLY ELECTIONS, [[THE DC|| 26]] GIVES THE IMPRESSION OF BEING WILLING TO TAKE THIS RISK RATHER THAN COMPROMISE, PARTICULARLY ON [[COMMUNIST|| 24]] PARTICIPATION. [[THE COMMUNISTS||24 ]] ALSO WOULD PREFER TO AVOID EARLY ELECTIONS BUT IN [[THEIR CURRENT|| 24]] NO-LOSE POSITION HAVE LITTLE REASON TO FEAR THEM. (CONFIDENTIAL) [[ROME|| 25]] 773, 1/16.)

IF [[ALBRECHT || 32]] CAN FORM A GOVERNMENT IN [[LOWER SAXONY || 28]] IMPORTANT [[FEDERAL  || 33]] LEGISLATION COULD POSSIBLY BE STYMIED AND THE [[POLISH || 34]] AGREE- MENTS MIGHT ALSO BE JEOPARDIZED. DURING A CONVERSATION WITH [[AMBASSADOR HILLENBRAND || 35]], [[CHANCELLOR SCHMIDT  || 36]] EXPRESSED CONSIDERABLE PUZZLEMENT OVER THE ELECTION. [[HE || 36]] COULD NOT EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED BUT FELT THE RESULTS WERE CLEARLY BAD. [[EMBASSY || 30]] COMMENT: [[ALBRECHT'S || 32]] ELECTION WAS A SETBACK FOR THE COALITION IN [[BONN || 27]]. IT MAY SERVE TO UNDERMINE THIS PARTNER- SHIP AND WILL ALSO GIVE [[THE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS || 31]] A PSYCHO- LOGICAL BOOST IN THE UPCOMING [[BUNDESTAG  ||33 ]] ELECTION.

[[EMBASSY [[BUCHAREST  || 37]] || 43]] NOTES THAT [[THE GOR ||44 ]], TORN BETWEEN ITS NEED FOR GOOD RELATIONS WITH [[THE WEST || 45]] AND [[ITS ||44 ]] INTERNAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS, APPEARS INTENSELY CONCERNED LEST EMIGRATION CONCESSIONS ALREADY GRANTED GENERATE A MULTITUDE OF NEW DEMANDS.

6. [[TORRIJOS'|| 46]] TRIP TO [[CUBA|| 47]]
--SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY IN ANALYZING [[TORRIJOS'|| 46]] [[CUBAN|| 47]] JUNKET, [[EMBASSY [[PANAMA || 49]] || 48]] POINTS OUT:
--[[TORRIJOS|| 46]] PRAISED [[CUBAN|| 47]] ACHIEVEMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN EDUCATION, BUT EMPHATICALLY STATED THAT [[SOCIALISM ||51 ]] IS ONLY ONE WAY
--AND NOT [[PANAMA'S|| 49]]
--OF ACHIEVING A JUST SOCIETY.
--[[HIS|| 46]] VARIOUS STATEMENTS ON [[THE CANAL|| 50]] WERE GENERALLY RESTRAINED AND STATESMANLIKE. [[EMBASSY || 48]] COMMENT: [[TORRIJOS'||46 ]] [[CUBAN|| 47]] ADVENTURE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN WELL HANDLED. [[HIS||46 ]] WARM RECEPTION HAS HELPED UNDERCUT, FOR A TIME, [[HIS||46 ]] LEFTIST CRITICS BUT, BY THE POSITION [[HE||46 ]] TOOK ON [[SOCIALISM|| 51]], [[HE|| 46]] ALSO HAS REASSURED [[HIS|| 46]] CONSERVATIVE AUDIENCE.

7. [[THAILAND || 52]]
A. THE [[TERRORISTS'  || 53]] DRY SEASON [[[[THAI ||52 ]] COMMUNIST TERRORISTS || 53]] HAVE SO FAR FAILED TO MOUNT AN ANTICIPATED DRY-SEASON OFFENSIVE. THOUGH INSURGENT ACTIV- ITY HAS INCREASED IN [[THE NORTH || 52]], [[RTG OFFICIALS || 54]] SPECULATE THAT [[THE TERRORISTS ||53 ]] AND [[THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF [[THAILAND || 52]] || 55]] MAY BE SUFFERING FROM SEVERAL ILLS:
--[[THE PRC || 56]], WARMING TO [[THAI  || 54]] POLITICAL INITIATIVES, MAY BE SEEKING TO BRAKE [[CPT || 55]] INSURGENCY.
--THERE MAY BE DEVELOPING IN [[THE CPT || 55]] A GENERATION GAP BETWEEN OLDER, [[CHINA ||57 ]]-ORIENTED LEADERS AND YOUNGER ZEALOTS WHO SEE [[VIETNAM || 58]] AS THE HOPE OF THE FUTURE.
--LARGE-SCALE ATTACKS OF LAST SUMMER MAY HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO DESTROY [[LOYALIST ||59]] MORALE AND, FAILING IN THAT REGARD, BEEN GIVEN UP AS A TACTIC. [[EMBASSY || 60]] COMMENT: [[WE || 60]] SEE NO CHANGE IN [[PEKING'S || 56]] SUPPORT TO THE MOVEMENT AND, WITH FIVE MONTHS OF THE DRY SEASON REMAIN- ING, IT IS TOO EARLY TO WRITE OFF THE POSSIBLE RENEWAL OF LARGE-SCALE ATTACKS.
B. [[[[THAI || 52]]-[[LAO || 62]] BORDER  || 61]] INCIDENT [[CONSULATE [[UDORN  || 52]] ||63]] REPORTS THREE [[THAI  || 52]] PATROL BOATS WERE FIRED UPON FROM THE [[ LAO  ||62 ]] SIDE OF [[THE BORDER  || 61]] ON JANUARY 13, AND THEN RETURNED FIRE. NO DAMAGE WAS REPORTED IN THE SHORT EXCHANGE. (CONFIDENTIAL) [[BANGKOK ||60 ]] 1034 (EXDIS) AND [[BANGKOK  || 60]] 1019, 1/16.)
