1. (U) [[CHAIRMAN OF WORKING GROUP (LOEIS OF [[INDONESIA || 2]]) || 1]] REPORTED RESULTS OF PAST WEEK'S WORK TO PLENARY ON JULY 12, AND INTRODUCED HEAVILY BRACKETED DRAFT OF FINAL DOCUMENT (TEXT DATAFAXED TO [[IO/UNP ||5]]).


2. (U) IN ENSUING PARAGRAPH-BY-PARAGRAPH REVIEW, [[SOVIETS || 3]] AGAIN OBJECTED TO REPEATED REFERENCES TO "GREAT POWER RIVALRY," AND [[IRAQI REP ||4 ]] REITERATED VIEW THAT MEETING SHOULD SEEK THE EXCLUSION FROM THE [[INDIAN OCEAN ||6 ]] OF FOREIGN WARSHIPS LIKE THOSE OF [[THE U.S. || 7]] THAT WERE THREATENING OIL STATES.


3. (U) DURING AFTERNOON SESSION, [[U.S. REP || 7]] TOOK FLOOR BRIEFLY TO RECALL POINTS IN JULY 2 STATEMENT IN INDIRECT RESPONSE TO CHARGES BY [[SOVIETS ||3]] , [[IRAQIS || 4]] AND OTHERS IN GENERAL DEBATE (REFTEL). WITHOUT COMMENTING ON SPECIFIC PARAS IN DRAFT FINAL DOCUMENT, [[U.S. REP || 7]] REPEATED RATIONALE FOR BILATERAL TALKS (TO AVOID COMPETITIVE EXPANSION OF GREAT POWER MILITARY PRESENCE IN [[THE INDIAN OCEAN ||6]] ) AND REASONS FOR SUSPENSION OF THE TALKS, THE RESUMPTION OF WHICH IS TO BE DISCUSSED SHORTLY. RE ALLEGATIONS THAT [[U.S. NAVAL FORCES ||8]] MIGHT BE USED TO THREATEN STATES IN THE [[INDIAN OCEAN REGION || 6]] , [[U.S. REP ||7]] SAID NO MILITARY DEPLOYMENTS WERE MADE BY [[U.S. || 7]] WITH INTENTION OF THREATENING TO USE FORCE IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE [[UN || 9]] CHARTER, FOR WHICH [[U.S. || 7]] RECORD OF SUPPORT IS SECOND TO NONE. AS MEANS TO REDUCE NEED FOR STATES IN [[REGION ||6]] TO INVOKE RIGHTS OF SELF-DEFENSE AND COLLECTIVE SECURITY IN  [[UN || 9]] CHARTER, [[U.S. REP || 7]]  ENCOURAGED EFFORTS OF STATES AT MEETING TO WORK TOWARDS REGIONAL DISARMAMENT AND PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT MEASURES, WHICH [[U.S. || 7]] WOULD SUPPORT IN ANY APPROPRIATE WAY.


4. (U) DURING JULY 12 PLENARY, PARAS 1-13 OF DRAFT FINAL DOCUMENT WERE APPROVED BY CONSENSUS, PARA 14 WAS DROPPED, AND [[CHAIRMAN FERNANDO'S || 14]] COMPROMISE VERSION OF PARA 17 (OBLIGATIONS OF STATES IN REGION) AND PARA 21 (FREE NAVIGATION) WERE TENTATIVELY ACCEPTED. HOWEVER, CHAIRMAN'S COMPROMISE PROPOSAL FOR PARA 15 (DEFINITION OF [[INDIAN OCEAN ||6 ]] TO INCLUDE ADJACENT LAND AREAS) WAS REJECTED BY [[AUSTRALIA || 10]] , AND [[CHAIRMAN'S || 14]] PROPOSAL FOR PARA 16 (CESSATION OF "EVERY MANIFESTATION" OF GREAT POWER MILITARY PRESENCE) WAS REJECTED BY  [[AUSTRALIA||16]] AND [[JAPAN || 10]] . [[BOTH || 10]] MADE CLEAR [[THEY  || 10]] WOULD DISASSOCIATE [[THEMSELVES || 10]]  FROM FINAL DOCUMENT OF MEETING IF NO FURTHER CHANGES WERE MADE. [[BOTH || 10]] REJECTED PROPOSAL OF [[MADAGASCAR ||11]] THAT [[THEY || 10]] JOIN CONSENSUS "WITH RESERVATIONS".


5. (U) [[CHAIRMAN'S ||14]] COMPROMISE PROPOSAL FOR PARAS 22/23 WAS ALSO TENTATIVELY APPROVED, SUBJECT TO FURTHER CONSIDERATION ON JULY 13. TEXT IS AS FOLLOWS. BEGIN TEXT:


- THE MEETING RECOMMENDS TO [[THE GA ||12]]  AT [[ITS ||12]] 34TH REGULAR SESSION TO FIX THE DATE AND VENUE OF THE CONFERENCE ON [[THE INDIAN OCEAN  ||6]] AS CALLED FOR IN RES 33/68 AND TO ENTRUST THE AD HOC COMMITTEE ON  [[THE INDIAN OCEAN  ||6]], WHICH SHOULD BE EXPANDED FOR THIS PURPOSE, TO UNDERTAKE THE PREPARATORY WORK FOR THE CONFERENCE, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF APPROPRIATE ARRANGEMENTS FOR ANY INTERNATIONAL AGREE- MENT THAT MAY ULTIMATELY BE REACHED FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF [[THE INDIAN OCEAN  ||6]] AS A ZONE OF PEACE, AS REFERRED TO IN PARA 3 OF RESOLUTION 28/32. THE MEETING REQUESTS [[THE GA ||12]] TO INVITE [[THE [[PERMANENT SECURITY COUNCIL || 14]] MEMBERS  AND THE MAJOR MARITIME USERS || 15]] OF  [[THE INDIAN OCEAN  ||6]]  WHO HAVE NOT YET DONE SO TO SERVE ON THE EXPANDED AD HOC COMMITTEE TO FACILITATE PREPARATIONS FOR THE CONFERENCE. END TEXT.


6. (LOU) COMMENT: ISOLATION OF [[JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA || 10]] ON PARA 16 IS MORE APPARENT THAN REAL. [[MENDELEVICH || 17]] ([[USSR || 3]]) TOLD [[US REP || 7]] THAT TEXT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO [[SOVIETS || 3]] EITHER. HOWEVER, [[AUSTRALIANS || 16]] IN PARTICULAR TOOK CONSIDERABLE HEAT DURING PLENARY MEETING AND WELCOMED [[U.S. || 7]] INTERVENTION, WHICH HELPED STIFFEN [[THEIR || 16]] BACKBONE TO RESIST UNACCEPTABLE PROPOSALS BY [[CHAIRMAN || 14]] . AFTER MEETING, [[INDONESIAN REP ||18]] SAID [[U.S. || 7]]  INTERVENTION WAS TIMELY AND CHARACTERIZED IT AS "FINE RIPOSTE."
