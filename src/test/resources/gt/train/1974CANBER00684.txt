[[EMBOFF  || 20]] NOTED THAT [[OUR || 21]] INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO PRESENT RATIONALE, WHICH SPEAKS FOR ITSELF BUT AGREED TO BRING TO ATTENTION OF [[DEPT || 1]] FACT THAT [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] HAD MADE INQUIRY ON THIS POINT. END SUMMARY.




2. IN ACCORDANCE WITH INSTRUCTIONS IN REF A, ON FEB 5 [[EMBOFF || 20]] AND [[COUNSELOR OF [[ BRITISH HIGH COMMISSION || 3]] (BRYAN BARDER ||15]]) PRESENTED [[[[AUSTRALIAN DEPT OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS || 5 ]] (BLAKENEY, FIRST ASSISTANT SECRETARY, DEFENSE DIVISION || 7]]) WITH RATIONALE ON NAVAL DEPLOYMENTS IN [[INDIAN OCEAN || 14]] AND EXPANSION OF [[DIEGO GARCIA || 6]], USING MATERIAL IN REF B AS AMENDED BY SERIES OF [[DEPARTMENT ||1]] AND [[AMEMBASSY [[LONDON || 17]]  || 16]] TELS.

3. [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] UNDERTOOK TO STUDY AIDE MEMOIRE WHICH, [[HE|| 7]] SAID, WOULD BE REFERRED TO [[[[AUSTRALIAN || 4]] DEPT OF DEFENSE || 9]] AND [[CABINET MINISTERS || 10]]. [[HE|| 7]] SAID [[HE|| 7]] MAY BE BACK IN TOUCH WITH [[US ||10]] ON SPECIFIC ASPECTS. HE ASKED FOR DETAILS ON  [[[[SOVIET || 12]]  NAVAL || 13]] PRESENCE REFERRED IN AIDE MEMOIRE (I.E., IN REF B).  [[EMBOFF || 20]]  REPLIED THAT DETAILS ON [[[[SOVIET || 12 ]]  NAVAL || 13]] MOVEMENTS IN [[INDIAN OCEAN || 14]] ARE PERIODICALLY PROVIDED TO [[GOA ||4]] THROUGH SERVICE CHANNELS AND THAT [[HE || 20 ]] DID NOT HAVE A CURRENT LIST. HOWEVER, THIS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FROM [[ROYAL [[AUSTRA- LIAN || 4]] NAVY || 18]]. [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] ASKED FOR DETAILS ON [[[[U.S. || 11]] NAVAL || 19]] DEPLOYMENTS TO [[INDIAN OCEAN || 14]].  [[EMBOFF || 20]]  RECALLED THAT CHARGE HAD PROVIDED [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] WITH LIST OF ANTI- CIPATED MOVEMENTS ON JAN 30.




4. [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] RECALLED THAT [[AMBASSADOR RICE || 23]] HAD WRITTEN TO [[THEN PRIME MINISTER MCMAHON || 22]] ON JAN 14, 1972, REVIEWING [[ U.S. || 11]] PLANS FOR DEPLOYMENT OF [[NAVAL UNITS || 19]]  TO [[INDIAN OCEAN|| 14]]. (LETTER CONVEYED INFO IN REF C). [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] NOTED THAT LETTER HAD STATED [[ U.S. || 11]] WANTS TO AVOID COMPETITION WITH SOVIETS IN [[INDIAN OCEAN || 14]] AND THAT DEPLOYMENTS WOULD BE IN LOW KEY. AIDE MEMOIRE DID NOT APPEAR TO CONTAIN THESE POINTS, AND [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] WONDERED IF THERE HAD BEEN CHANGE. [[EMBOFF ||20]] NOTED THAT RATIONALE RECALLED THAT VISITS OF [[[[ U.S. || 11]] NAVY ||19]] VESSELS TO [[INDIAN OCEAN || 14]] HAD BEEN DISRUPTED BY [[VIETNAM || 24]] WAR AND THAT [[SECRETARY SCHLESINGER || 25]] HAD INDICATED THAT [[WE || 11]] EXPECT [[[[ U.S. || 11]]NAVY ||19]] VISITS IN THE FUTURE WILL BE MORE FREQUENT THAN IN PAST. [[EMBOFF ||20]] ALSO NOTED THAT AIDE MEMOIRE (PARA 3, REF B) STATES THAT "DEPLOYMENTS ARE NOT A THREAT TO ANY NATION OR GROUP OF NATIONS." HOWEVER, [[EMBOFF ||20]] NOTED THAT [[OUR ||21]] INSTRUCTIONS WERE TO PRESENT AIDE MEMOIRE, WHICH SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. [[EMBOFF ||20]] AGREED TO BRING TO ATTENTION OF [[DEPT ||1]] FACT THAT [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] HAD MADE INQUIRY ON THIS POINT.




5.

[[BARDER ||15]] FURTHER NOTED THAT THE INCREASED DEPLOYMENTS AND EXTENSION OF FACILITIES AT [[DIEGO GARCIA || 6]] ARE IN WESTERN INTERESTS IN GENERAL, RATHER THAN PRIMARILY RELATED TO RECENT [[MIDDLE EAST || 26]] EVENTS. [[HE ||15]] SAID THAT THE PROSPECT OF REOPENING OF [[SUEZ CANAL || 27]] AND POSSIBLE INCREASE IN  [[[[SOVIET || 12]]  NAVAL || 13]]  PRESENCE IN [[INDIAN OCEAN || 14]] WERE ALSO RELEVANT FACTORS. [[HE ||15]]  ADDED THAT [[BRITISH ||2]] INVOLVEMENT IN [[DIEGO GARCIA || 6]] EXTENSIONS IS LIMITED TO THE PROVISION OF THE NECESSARY REAL ESTATE. [[HE ||15]] STATED THAT THERE WOULD BE [[PARLIAMENTARY || 28]] QEUSTION AND ANSWER ON [[DIEGO GARCIA || 6]] IN [[HOUSE OF COMMONS ||29 ]] FEB. 5 AND THAT [[HE ||15]]  WOULD PROVIDE [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] WITH COPY OF EXCHANGE.

[[BLAKENEY|| 7]] SAID THAT [[HE ||15]]  HAD RECEIVED A REPORT THAT THIS HAD BEEN DONE.




7. COMMENT: [[BLAKENEY|| 7]] IS METHODICAL AND CAREFUL WORKER, AND QUESTIONS [[HE|| 7]]  RAISED WERE CLEARLY INTENDED TO BRING OUT POINTS  [[HE|| 7]] ANTICIPATED WOULD BE RAISED BY [[[[AUSTRALIAN || 4]] CABINET MINISTERS || 9]] . [[HIS || 7]]  ATTITUDE WAS FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL, AS  [[HE|| 7]] ALWAYS IS. END COMMENT.
