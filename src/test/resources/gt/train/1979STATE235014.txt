1. (C-ENTIRE TEXT)


2. AS REPORTED PARA 3 REFTEL (A) [[WE || 1]] ASKED [[USDOC'S [[NEVADA|| 4]] FIELD OFFICE ||5 ]] TO INVESTIGATE CURRENT DISPUTE BETWEEN [[ROMANIA|| 6]] AND [[ROMAMER PHARMACEUTICALS, LTD.|| 7]] MAJOR POINTS OF [[FIELD OFFICE|| 5]] DISCUSSION WITH [[MARVIN KRATTER|| 8]], [[[[ROMAMER'S|| 7]] PRESIDENT|| 8]], ARE AS FOLLOWS:
A. [[KRATTER|| 8]] WAS TO BE IN [[FRANCE || 9]] IN AUGUST AT WHICH TIME [[HE ||8]] WOULD MEET WITH [[ROMANIAN OFFICIALS || 10]] TO ARRANGE MEETING IN [[BUCHAREST || 6]] LATER THIS FALL.
B. IF NEGOTIATIONS FAIL, [[KRATTER|| 8]] WOULD WELCOME ARBITRATION, WHICH UNDER THE CONTRACT WOULD BE IN [[FRANCE || 9]] . [[HE ||8]] IS CONFIDENT [[ROMANIA|| 10]] WOULD LOSE.
C. [[KRATTER|| 8]] WOULD ALSO WELCOME A LAWSUIT BECAUSE [[HE ||8]] WOULD THEN COUNTERSUE FOR QUOTE TEN MILLION DOLLARS UNQUOTE BECAUSE OF CONTRACT BREACH BY [[ROMANIANS|| 10]]. [[KRATTER|| 8]] CLAIMS [[ROMANIANS|| 10]] HIRED A [[[[NEW YORK || 4]] ATTORNEY|| 11]], [[ROBERT HELANDER|| 11]], WHO HAS TOLD [[THEM||10]] THEY PROBABLY DO NOT HAVE A CASE.
D. [[KRATTER|| 8]] STATED THAT [[ROMANIA'S||10]] [[U.S.||4]] TRADEMARK IS BEING CHALLENGED AND THAT DESPITE [[GOR||10]] CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY, [[IT||10]] DOES NOT HAVE A [[CANADIAN||12]] TRADEMARK.
E. [[ROMANIANS ||10]] OFFERED TO BUY [[ROMAMER ||7]] FROM [[KRATTER|| 8]] BUT AT RIDICULOUSLY LOW PRICE.


3. [[FIELD OFFICE || 5]] EXPLAINED THAT GEROVITAL REMAINS AVAILABLE IN [[NEVADA||4]] BY PRESCRIPTION. THE I979 [[[[NEVADA || 13]] LEGISLATURE || 14]] DID NOT ACT ON A BILL THAT WOULD PERMIT PURCHASE OF GEROVITAL WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PROPOSED BILL [[KRATTER|| 8]] WAS ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH QUOTE ATTEMPTING AND CONSPIRING TO BRIBE UNQUOTE A [[[[STATE || 13]] LEGISLATOR||14]]. HOWEVER, [[HE ||8]] HAS POSTED BOND AND CONTINUES TO DO BUSINESS WHILE CHARGES ARE PENDING. ALSO, NO FURTHER [[LEGISLATIVE ||14]] ACTION ON THE PROPOSED BILL IS EXPECTED UNTIL THE NEXT SESSION OF [[[[NEVADA || 13]] LEGISLATURE || 14]] IN 1980.


4. SUBSEQUENTLY, [[WE || 1]] LEARNED FROM [[[[GOR || 10]] ECONOMIC COUNSELOR FODOR || 15]] THAT MEETINGSHELD WITH [[KRATTER|| 8]] [[HERE|| 4]] IN JULY (FOLLOWING [[ECONOMIC COUNCIL || 16]] MEETING) AND IN [[FRANCE || 9]]  IN AUGUST HAD NOT ACHIEVED PROGRESS.


5. ACTION REQUESTED: PLEASE INFORM [[MARGARITESCU ||17 ]] AS FOLLOWS: THE [[USDOC FIELD OFFICE || 5]] HAS LOOKED INTO GEROVITAL MATTER AS [[JENKINS ||18]] PROMISED DURING [[HIS|| 18]] [[WASHINGTON || 4]] MEETING. NOTWITHSTANDING APPARENTLY INCONCLUSIVE SUMMER MEETINGS,[[KRATTER|| 8]] APPEARS WILLING TO NEGOTIATE AND [[WE ||1]] URGE [[GOR||10]] TO CONTINUE THESE TALKS. [[WE ||1]] WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION THROUGH [[KRATTER|| 8]] AND [[[[ROMANIAN ||10]] COMMERCIAL OFFICE || 19]] IN [[NEW YORK|| 4]] (FYI-PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ANY LEGAL ACTIONS TAKEN AGAINST [[KRATTER|| 8]]-END FYI). IF THESE NEGOTIATIONS FAIL, ONLY REMEDY [[WE||1]] SEE IS ARBITRATION ALTHOUGH DISPUTE MAY LEND ITSELF TO RESOLUTION THROUGH [[ECONOMIC COUNCIL'S|| 16]] PRE-ARBITRAL CONCILIATION PROCEDURE IF [[BOTH PARTIES|| 20]] WOULD AGREE.


6. [[WE ||1]] ARE POUCHING TO [[EMBASSY||2]] COPY OF [[[[NEVADA || 4]] FIELD OFFICE || 5]] MEMORANDUM AND OTHER PERTINENT MATERIALS.
