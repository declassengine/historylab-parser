1. THE LOCAL PRESS CONTINUES TO GIVE HEAVY PLAY TO THE EMBEZZLE- MENT TRIAL OF [[FORMER [[SOZACOM || 1 ]] DIRECTOR ZOLA KINKELA || 2]]. [[ELIMA ||3]] OF SATURDAY, NOV 19, PUBLISHED THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE SUMMARIZING CURRENT STATE OF PLAY (UNOFFICIAL [[EMBASSY || 4]] TRANSLATION): BEGIN QUOTE THE [[SOZACOM || 1 ]] AFFAIR THIS MORNING AT 9 [[THE COURT|| 6]] RECONVENES WHERE ARE WE IN TERMS OF THE TRIAL OF [[ZOLA KINKELA || 2]]




A. AS [[WE ||4]] KNOW [[THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF [[KINSHASA || 7]] || 6]] HAS BEFORE [[IT|| 6]] AN IMPORTANT CASE CONCERNING MISAPPROPRIATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS BY [[THE FORMER DELEGUE GENERAL OF [[SOZACOM || 1 ]], ZOLA KINKELA || 2]].
B. THREE CHARGES WERE LODGED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR AGAINST [[THE ACCUSED|| 2]]. [[THE COURT|| 6]] HAS ALREADY EXAMINED THE FIRST TWO CHARGES, THAT IS, THE EMBEZZLEMENT OF BF30 MILLION WHICH WERE TRANSFERRED FROM A [[FRENCH || 9]]  BANK TO [[THE UNION OF [[SWISS || 10]] BANKS || 11]] AT [[GENEVA || 10]] BY [[THE FORMER [[SOZACOM||1]]  DG|| 2]], AS WELL AS THE CASH SHORTFALL FO Z40,307. [[THE COURT|| 6]] HAS NOT YET REACHED A VERDICT ON THESE TWO CHARGES. THERE ARE CERTAIN CLARIFICATIONS LEFT TO BE OBTAINED.
C. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IN [[ITS || 6]] SESSION TODAY [[THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE || 6]] , ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATION  [[WE ||4]] HAVE RECEIVED FROM RELIABLE SOURCES, WILL CONCERN ITSELF ESPECIALLY WITH THE THIRD CHARGE: EMBEZZLEMENT OF THE SUM OF Z74,000 WHICH [[THE FORMER DG || 2]] CLAIMS TO HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM A [[ZAIRIAN || 5]] BANK AND PUT INTO THE HANDS OF THE [[TRUSTEESHIP AUTHORITY || 13]], THAT IS, [[THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF [[THE OFFICE OF [[THE PRESIDENT-FOUNDER || 17]] || 16]], BISENGIMANA RWEMA || 13]].
D. AS  [[WE ||4]] WROTE IN LAST THURSDAY'S EDITION, [[THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF [[THE OFFICE OF [[THE PRESIDENT ||17]] || 16]] OF [[THE REPUBLIC || 5]] || 13]] IS NOT ON TRIAL IN [[THIS COURT|| 6]]. BUT AS [[THE ACCUSED || 2]] STATES THAT ONLY [[CIT. BISENGI- MANA || 13]] KNOWS THE DESTINATION OF THAT MONEY, IT MAY BE THAT PERHAPS THE DEFENSE WILL APPLY TO [[THE COURT || 6]] TO CALL FOR THE PRESENCE ON THE STAND OF [[THE FORMER DIRECTOR OF [[THE OFFICE OF [[THE PRESIDENT-FOUNDER || 17]] || 16]] || 13]] AS A WITNESS.




E. THESE ARE THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS OF AN AFFAIR WHICH HAS BEEN IN THE NEWS FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS. THIS MORNING'S SESSION WILL, WITHOUT A DOUBT, SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE CHARGES AGAINST [[THE FORMER [[SOZACOM ||1 ]] DG || 2]]. THUS, IT IS A CASE WORTH FOLLOWING. END QUOTE.




2. PRESS REPORTS INDICATED THAT AS OF NOVEMBER 21 [[THE COURT|| 6]] HAD DECIDED THAT, BECAUSE OF [[HIS || 2]] POSITION AS SOLE AUTHORIZER OF [[SOZACOM || 1]] DISBURSEMENTS, [[ZOLA|| 2]] WAS THE ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE UTILIZA- TION OF THE BF30 MILLION AND THE Z40,397 MENTIONED IN THE FIRST TWO CHARGES. REGARDING THE THIRD CHARGE, A DEPOSITION BY [[MALOLO KISIMBILA , COUNSELOR OF [[THE OFFICE OF [[THE PRESIDENT || 17]]  || 16]] || 14]], WAS PLACED IN EVIDENCE, STATING THAT THE Z74,000 HAD BEEN GIVEN TO [[ZOLA|| 2]] ON [[BISENGIMANA'S ||13]] ORDERS TO ENABLE [[HIM|| 2]] TO CONSTRUCT A VILLA. [[MALOLO'S||14]] TESTIMONY STATED THIS WAS A GIFT, NOT A LOAN AND IN NO WAY A DEBT OR EMBEZZLEMENT. AT THE REQUEST OF THE PROSECUTION, THE TRIAL HAS BEEN RECESSED UNTIL NOVEMBER 30 TO ENABLE FURTHER TESTIMONY TO BE HEARD FROM [[MALOLO HIMSELF||14]]. THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS FOR THE DEFENSE ARE ALSO EXPECTED TO BE HEARD AT THAT TIME. END UNCLASSIFIED




3. COMMENT: THERE HAS BEEN NO FURTHER MENTION OF [[BISENGIMANA'S ||13]] BEING CALLED TO TESTIFY, AND, FROM THE TONE OF THE MOST RECENT ARTICLES, [[HIS || 13]] APPEARANCE DOES NOT SEEM LIKELY.




END




[[LOU CUTLER || 15]]
