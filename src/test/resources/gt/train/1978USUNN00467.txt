1. IN INCONCLUSIVE DISCUSSION OF [[VIETNAMESE || 1]] COMPLAINT AGAINST [[US||2]]  ACTION TO EXPEL [[[[SRV ||1]] PERM REP || 19]], [[UN HOST COUNTRY RELATIONS COMMITTEE || 4]] FEBRUARY 9 HEARD STATEMENTS FROM 16 DELEGATES: [[SRV ||1]], [[US ||2]], [[USSR || 5]], [[IRAQ || 6]], [[BULGARIA || 7]], [[UKRAINE || 8]], [[CUBA || 9]], [[HUNGARY || 10]], [[MONGOLIA || 11]], [[POLAND || 12]], [[GDR || 13]], [[UK || 14]], [[CZECHOSLOVAKIA || 15]], [[BENIN || 16]], [[SENEGAL || 17]], AND [[BYELORUSSIA || 18]]. COMMITTEE WILL MEET AGAIN FEBRUARY 10 WITH [[SENEGAL'S ||17]]PROPOSAL FOR [[UN ||3]] LEGAL OPINION AS FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS.


2. [[SRV PERM REP DINH BA THI ||19]] OPENED WITH STATEMENT RE- ITERATING [[HIS ||19]] PAST PUBLIC DENIALS OF ACCUSATIONS AGAINST [[HIM ||19]]. [[[[SRV || 1]] LEGAL COUNSEL || 20]] THEN TOOK FLOOR TO CONTEND US DID NOT FOLLOW PROPER PROCEDURES FOR PRIOR CONSULTATION UNDER SECTION 13 OF HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT. [[HE ||20]] CONCLUDED WITH CALL FOR ACTION AT NEXT [[GENERAL ASSEMBLY || 21]] (A) CONDEMNING [[US ||2]] "ILLEGAL" ACTIONS AGAINST A MEMBER STATE AND (B) "COMPLETING" HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT AND [[VIENNA || 22 ]] CONVENTION TO SHOW "ABSOLUTE INDEPENDENCE" OF [[UN ||3]] REGARDING PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES OF REPS OF MEMBER STATES.


3. [[AMB LEONARD || 23]] DELIVERED PREPARED STATEMENT ([[DEPT || 24]]HAS TEXT). [[HE || 23]] REVIEWED PERTINENT PROVISIONS OF HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT AND STEPS TAKEN BY [[US || 2]] IN FULFILLING THEM. [[HE || 23]] EMPHASIZED ACTION TAKEN BECAUSE OF [[THI'S || 19]] PERSONAL INVOLVE- MENT IN CASE INVOLVING [[US || 2]] NATIONAL SECURITY, THAT [[WE ||2]] DO NOT WISH THIS EVENT SERIOUSLY TO AFFECT NORMALIZATION OF [[US||  2]]-[[SRV || 1]] RELATIONS, AND THAT [[OUR||2]] ACTION IN NO WAY AFFECTS RIGHT OF [[SRV || 1]] TO NAME NEW PERM REP IMMEDIATELY.


4. [[SOVIETS ||5]] AND LONG LIST OF OTHER SPEAKERS (MOST WITH OBSERVER STATUS IN [[COMMITTEE ||4]]) EXPRESSED SOLIDARITY AND FULL SUPPORT FOR [[SRV ||1]] POSITION AND CITED "DANGEROUS PRECEDENT" THIS CASE COULD SET. SEVERAL MEMBERS CALLED FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF ACTION BY [[COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN || 4]]: TO UNDERTAKE FURTHER CONSULTATIONS WITH [[US ||2]] UNDER HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT ([[BULGARIA ||7]]); TO SEEK FURTHER CLARIFICATION AND INFORM MEMBER STATES ([[CZECHOSLOVAKIA ||15]]); AND TO DISCUSS SITUATION WITH [[SYG ||1]] AND REPORT ON FINDINGS ([[POLAND || 12]]).


5. [[[[UK || 14]] REP ||25]] DEPLORED LACK OF OBJECTIVITY, NOTING COMMITTEE NOT IN POSSESSION OF FACTS AND SHOULD SHOW RESPECT FOR ASSERTIONS OF BOTH PARTIES. [[HE||25]] QUESTIONED ROLE OF [[COMMITTEE ||4]] IN MATTER, POINTING OUT [[IT||4]] HAD NO ROLE IN MACHINERY OF HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT. OTHER COUNTRIES WERE HOSTS TO INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, [[HE||25]] NOTED, AND [[HE||25]] DOUBTED ANY ONE OF THEM WOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE UP POWER TO ASK [[FOREIGN REP ||19]] TO DEPART UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS IN THIS CASE. [[HE||25]] THOUGHT FIRST THING FOR [[COMMITTEE ||4]] TO DECIDE WAS WHAT [[ITS||4]] LIMITS WERE IN THIS SORT OF CASE.


6. MEETING ENDED FOLLOWING INCONCLUSIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN [[SENEGAL || 17]] (FALL) ON ONE HAND AND [[[[COMMITTEE ||4]] CHAIRMAN ROSSIDES ([[CYPRUS|| 26]]) || 27]] AND [[[[UN || 3]] LEGAL COUNSEL SUY || 28]] ON OTHER OVER [[SENEGAL'S ||17]] PROPOSAL THAT [[SUY || 28]] GIVE OPINION ON WHETHER PROVISIONS OF SECTION 13(B) OF HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT REGARDING PRIOR CONSULTATION WITH MEMBER STATE HAD BEEN FULFILLED. [[SUY || 28]] AND [[ROSSIDES|| 27]] ARGUED THAT WHAT [[SENEGAL||17]] WAS ASKING WAS NOT QUESTION OF LEGAL INTERPRETATION OF TEXT BUT A DECISION ON FACTS OF CASE WHICH IT WAS NOT APPROPRIATE FOR LEGAL COUNSEL TO MAKE. IN VIEW OF LATE HOUR AND ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS TO BE HEARD, [[CHAIRMAN ||27]] SAID THIS QUESTION WOULD BE DISCUSSED FURTHER AT ANOTHER MEETING OF [[COMMITTEE ||4]] AT 3:00 PM FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 10.
