1. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, [[LAWYER FOR COLONEL MAMPA||2 ]], [[MBU NE LETANG||2 ]], CALLED AT [[CONSULATE|| 3]] AT NOON ON AUGUST 19. [[HE|| 2]] SAID REASON WAS TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO [[JEFF || 25]], BUT [[HE|| 2]] IMMEDIATELY OPENED UP ON CASE OF [[COLOGL MAMPA|| 1]].


2. [[MBU || 2]] CONFIRMED POINTS MADE IN REFTEL A BY [[[[FRENCH|| 4]] CONSUL || 5]] (APPARENTLY UNAWARE [[FRENCH || 4]] HAD ALREADY GIVEN [[US || 3]] SAME INFORMATION), BUT NOTED THAT [[MAMPA'S|| 1]] ROLE IN [[CIS|| 6]] EVACUATION WAS DIRECT PART OF ACCUSATION DURING TRIAL. [[HE || 2]] SAID PROSECUTOR CHARGED THAT[[ MAMPA'S || 1]] PERMISSION FOR [[CIS||6 ]] EVACUATION WAS PART OF CAMPAIGN TO DEMORALIZE [[YDZ|| 7]] WHEN [[KOLWEZI|| 8]] UNDER ATTACK. [[MAMPA || 1]] DENIED CHARGE AND TOLD ABOUT VISIT FROM [[COLONEL POWERS|| 9]] AND [[[[CIS || 6]] SECURITY CHIEF|| 10]]ON EVACUATION DAY.


3. [[MBU || 2]] SAID TRIAL CONDUCTED IN VERY OPEN MANNER AT [[ KOLWEZI ||8]] THEATER WITH LARGE AUDIENCE OF MILITARY AND CIVILIANS. THREE LAWYERS REPRESENTED [[MAMPA || 1]] BEFORE TRIBUNAL OF FIVE MILITARY OFFICIALS. [[MBU ||2]] HAD EASY ACCESS TO [[MAMPA || 1]] IN DAYS BEFORE TRIAL. [[HE ||2]] SAID OPENING OF TRIAL POSTPONED ON DAILY BASIS FROM BEGINNING OF WEEK. TRIAL BEGAN AT 9:00 ON AUGUST 17 AND TRIBUNAL REACHED GUILTY VERDICT ON EVENING OF SAME DAY. WHILE BASIC CHARGES AGAINST [[MAMPA || 1]] KNOWN ON ABOUT JULY 28 (EXCLUDING [[CIS|| 6]]  RELATIONSHIP), MODIFICATIONS CONTINUED UNTIL NOON ON AUGUST 18 WHEN [[MBU || 2]] SAID [[HE ||2]] ACCIDENTALLY SAW FINAL LIST.


4. [[MBU || 2]] CHARACTERIZED CHARGES AS A JOKE AND SAID CASE WAS EMPTY OF SUBSTANCE. ONLY CONNECTION WITH [[MUNGUYA ||11 ]] WAS THAT [[THEY || 13]]  WERE [[BOTH|| 13]]  FROM [[MAI-NDOMBE SOUS-REGION OF BANDUNDU|| 8]] , BUT NOT EVEN ACQUAINTED. [[HE ||2]] ALSO SEEMED WELL-AWARE THAT [[CIS|| 6]]  EVACUATION AUTHORIZED BY [[KINSHASA|| 12]]. [[MBU || 2]] SPECULATYJ THAT IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY TO FIND HIGH- LEVEL SCAPEGOAT FOR EARLY DISASTERS OF WAR AND CHOICE AMONG [[BUMBA, ELUKI, AND MAMPA || 14]] LEFT [[MAMPA || 1]] AS THE MAN LEAST CLOSE TO [[PRESIDENT|| 15]] .


5. [[MBU || 2]] SAID [[TRIBUNAL|| 16]]  DIVIDED ON GUILTY DECISION AND INDIVIDUALS CLOSE TO [[PRESIDENCY|| 15]]  MADE DIFFERENCE. [[MBU || 2]] SAID THEY PLAN TO APPEAL CONVICTION ON GROUNDS THAT [[MILITARY TRIBUNAL || 16]] NOT COMPETENT BODY TO TRY MEMBER OF [[POLITICAL PUREAU || 12]]. [[HE ||2]] SAID [[MAMPA || 1]] SHOULD GET SAME LEVEL OF TRIAL AS PLANNED FOR [[NGUZA|| 26 ]] .


6. [[MBU || 2]] SAID [[HE ||2]] HAD TAKEN CASE BECAUSE [[MAMPA || 1]] WAS SHILD- HOOD FRIEND ([[MBU || 2]] IS ALSO FROM [[MAI-NDOMBE||8]]). [[HE ||2]] DID NOT SEE ANY UNFAVORABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR [[HIMSELF||2]] FOR DEFENDING [[MAMPA || 1]].


7. [[CONSULATE || 3]] COMMENT: [[MBU || 2]] VERY OPEN IN [[HIS ||2]] DISCUSSION OF THE CASE, ALMOST WITH A DAMN THE CONSEQUENCES ATTITUDE. [[WE || 3]] TOOK EXTREMELY PASSIVE ROLE, BASICALLY LISTENING TO WHATEVER [[HE ||2]] HAD TO SAY.


8. [[YOU ||17]] SHOULD BE AWARE THAT [[MBU || 2]] INFORMED [[US|| 3]] IN EARLY JUNE IN VAGUE MANNER [[HE ||2]] HAD PICKED UP RUMOR THAT [[ I || 3]] MIGHT BE PNG'D. [[HE||2]] WAS ONE OF TWO [[[[LUBUMBASHI || 8]] ZAIRIANS  || 18]] WHO WITHOUT SOLICITATION, EXPRESSED CONCERN AND SUGGESTED THAT SITTING TIGHT WAS BEST POLICY. [[HE ||2]] ALSO IS OWNER OF FARM WHERE [[I || 3]] FIRST MET [[DR. MAMBIKA || 19]] WHOSE SUBSEQUENT CHARGES AGAINST [[ME|| 3]] WERE BASIS OF [[CND|| 20]] NOTE OF MAY 25.


9. WHILE GRANT PLOT INVOLVING [[MBU || 2]] COULD BE ENVISIONED, [[WE|| 3]] BELIEVE CIRCUMSTANCES UNRELATED. [[WE|| 3]] HAVE NEVER SUSPECTED [[MBU || 2]], WHO IS ALSO [[PRESIDENT OF [[ROTARY|| 21]] || 2]], AS BEING [[CND||20 ]] INFORMANT. RATHER [[HE ||2]] IS INDEPENDENT AND OUTSPOKEN LAWYER INVOLVED IN ALMOST EVERYTHING OF IMPORTANCE IN [[SHABA|| 24]]. NEEDLESS TO SAY, [[WE|| 3]] ARE KEEPING LOW PROFILE.
