SUMMARY. POLITICAL ACTIVITY IN [[PERU ||1 ]] IS FOCUSING ON POSSIBLE ALLIANCES OR UNDERSTANDINGS TO FORM A WORKING MAJORITY IN THE FORTHCOMING ASSEMBLY. [[APRA || 2]] IS THE KEY WITH THE SINGLE LARGEST BLOC OF SEATS AND [[ITS || 2]] POSITION BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND LEFT. A DEAL WITH [[THE RIGHTIST PPC || 3]] IS FACING PROBLEMS. BOTH [[APRA || 2]] AND [[THE LARGEST PARTY ON THE LEFT, FOCEP || 4]] , ARE MAKING CONCILIATORY NOISES, BUT THE PROBLEM OF MILITARY OPPOSITION TO [[FOCEP || 4]] MUST BE CONSIDERED. MUCH OF CURRENT TALK MAY REPRESENT PARTISAN JOCKEY- ING BUT [[APRA || 2]] MAY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION BY THE TIME THE ASSEMBLY OPENS JULY 28 WHEN [[HAYA'S || 5]] ELECTION TO THE PRESIDENCY OR OTHER ISSUES MUST BE FACED. END SUMMARY.


1. ALTHOUGH THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE JUNE 18 CONSTITUENT ELECTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED, IT IS APPARENT THAT NO PARTY WILL HAVE A SIMPLE MAJORITY. AS A RESULT, TALK IN POLITICAL CIRCLES IN [[PERU ||1 ]] NOW CENTERS ON PROSPECTS FOR COALITIONS, ALLIANCES OR UNDERSTANDINGS AS THE THREE MAJOR GROUPS - CENTER, RIGHT AND LEFT, EXPLORE THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF VARIOUS COMBINATIONS. CENTRAL TO THIS EXERCISE IS [[THE APRA || 2]], REPRESENTING NOT ONLY THE LARGEST NUMBER OF SEATS (AT LEAST 36 OR 37) BUT ALSO THE MODERATE BALANCING FORCE BETWPOSTHE MAJXERTIES OF THE LEFT ([[FOCEP || 4]]) AND THE RIGHT ([[[[BEDOYA'S || 6]] PPC || 3]]).


2. [[APRA || 2]] HAS FOUR OPTIONS TO EXPLORE IN ITS EFFORT TO ASSURE ITS DOMINANCE OF THE ASSEMBLY; -- A DEAL WITH [[THE  PPC || 3]]; -- ALLIANCE WITH THE SMALLER PARTIES ([[MDP || 7]], [[UNO || 8]], [[FNTC || 9]]) PLUS SOME VOTES STOLEN FROM [[ PPC’S || 3]] ALLEGEDLY INDISCIPLINED BLOC; -- A "SHIFTING ALLIANCE" STRATEGY, SIDING WITH THE LEFT OR RIGHT ON INDIVIDUAL ISSUES AS SUGGESTED TO US BY [[[[APRA || 2]] LEADER TOWNSEND || 28 ]]  ([[LIMA ||1]] 5509); -- AND FINALLY, AN ARRANGEMENT WITH [[FOCEP || 4]] AND ITS ERSTWHILE ALLY, [[UDP ||10]].


3. THE MOST OBVIOUS ALLIANCE OF THE DEMOCRATIC FORCES - [[APRA || 2]] AND  [[PPC || 3]] - FACES SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS [[HAYA DE LA TORRE'S || 5]]  RECENT ASSERTION THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE "UNNATURAL". (BUT, OF COURSE, SO WERE [[APRA’S || 2]] EARLIER ALLIANCES WITH RIGHTISTS SUCH AS [[ODRIA ||11]] AND [[PRADO || 12]]). AND, THERE ARE INDICA- TIONS THAT [[APRA LEADERS || 2]] ARE FINDING A STRONG UNDERCURRENT OF OPPOSITION WITHIN [[PARTY RANKS || 2]] TO AN ASSOCIATION WITH THE RIGHT, ESPECIALLY FROM YOUTH, AND PERHAPS SOME SUPPORT FOR [[ARMANDO VILLANUEVA'S ||13]] THESIS THAT [[THE PARTY ||2]] SHOULD GET BACK TO [[ITS||2]] BASIC SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY. OPPOSITION TO A DEAL WITH [[THE  PPC || 3]] MAY ALSO BE A PRODUCT OF [[BEDOYA'S || 6]]  EXCESSES IN HIS CAMPAIGN AGAINST THE REFORMS OF THE REVOLUTIONARY GOVERNMENT WHICH SOME OBSERVERS CHARACTERIZE AS AN ELECTORAL TACTIC THAT BACKFIRED. ([[BEDOYA || 6]] MAY HAVE RECOGNIZED [[HIS|| 6]]  ERROR WHEN [[HE|| 6]]  BEGAN TO QUALIFY[[ HIS|| 6]]  POSITIONS ON AGRARIAN REFORM, ETC. TOWARD THE END OF [[HIS|| 6]]  CAMPAIGN). [[BEDOYA'S || 6]] REMARK THAT TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE ASSEMBLY WOULD BE A "WASTE OF TIME", ALONG WITH OTHER LONG-STANDING "AFFRONTS", ALSO MITIGATE AGAINST AN [[APRA || 2]] [[PPC || 3]] ALLIANCE.


4. AN [[APRA || 2]]-[[FOCEP || 4]]  ACCORD AT FIRST BLUSH APPEARS UNLIKELY, A MARRIA- GE BETWEEN THE NEW "ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT" FORCES OF THE EXTREME LEFT AND THE OLD-LINE ANTI-COMMUNIST [[APRA || 2]]. HOWEVER, GIVEN SAME DOC- TRINAL SIMILARITIES, ([[TROTSKYITE || 14]] OPPOSITION TO [[STALINIST||15]] COM- MUNISM) PLUS THE FACT THAT MANY [[FOCEP || 4]]  AND [[UDP || 10]] LEADERS ([[LEDESMA ||16]], [[NAPURI || 17]], [[SCORZA ||18]]) ||19]] WERE IN THE PAST [[APRA || 2]] SYMPATHIZERS OR MILITANTS, IT IS NOT TO BE ENTIRELY RULED OUT.


4. INDEED, IT IS APPARENT THAT NEITHER [[APRA || 2]] NOR [[FOCEP || 4]]  HAS DIS- MISSED THIS POSSIBILITY. [[VILLANUEVA ||13]] WAS QUICK TO EXTEND [[EXILED [[FOCEP || 4]]  LEADER LEDESMA || 16]]  [[HIS||13]] CONGRATULATIONS ON [[THE FRONT'S|| 4]]  SURPRIS- ING SHOWING. [[LEDESMA || 16]], IN A TELEPHONE INTERVIEW FROM [[PARIS || 20]] PUB- LISHED IN "X" REPAID THE COMPLIMENT IN REFERRING TO [[VILLANUEVA ||13]]  AS "[[[[MY ||16]] GOOD FRIEND AND (FORMER) PARLIAMENTARY COLLEAGUE || 13]]". MORE IMPORTANTLY, [[LEDESMA || 16]], WHILE APPARENTLY REJECTING AN [[APRA || 2]]-[[FOCEP || 4]]  ALLIANCE, ASSERTED THAT THERE ARE COINCIDENCES OF INTERESTS BET- WEEN THE TWO GROUPS AND SAID [[FOCEP || 4]]  MUST BE "FLEXIBLE" IN ITS DEALINGS WITHIN [[THE ASSEMBLY ||21]].


6. IF [[FOCEP || 4]]  AND [[THE UDP ||10]] GET TOGETHER (WHICH APPEARS LIKELY) AND IF [[FOCEP || 4]]  CAN KEEP ITS DISPARATE MEMBERSHIP IN LINE (A MAJOR TASK), CURRENT ARITHMETIC WOULD GIVE AN [[APRA || 2]]-[[FOCEP || 4]] -[[UDP ||10]] GROUPING PERHAPS A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF 51. HOWEVER, THERE ARE MAJOR RISKS TO THIS APPROACH IF INDEED IT IS BEING CONSIDERED SERIOUSLY IN [[APRA’S || 2]] INNER CIRCLES, THE MAJOR ONE BEING THE REACTION OF [[THE PERUVIAN MILITARY || 22]]. HISTORY HAS CHANGED SIGNIFI- CANTLY THE [[APRA || 2]]-[[MILITARY ||22]] RELATIONSHIP ([[LIMA ||1]] 5813), GIVING [[THE PARTY || 2]] ITS BEST CHANCE FOR POWER IN [[ITS || 2]] 50 YEARS OF ELECTIONEER- ING. BUT [[FOCEP || 4]]  (ALONG WITH [[THE PSR || 23]]) IS ANATHEMA TO [[THE ARMED FORCES||22]] AND A MOVE BY [[APRA || 2]] THAT APPEARED TO COMPROMISE IT WITH THE EXTREME, ANTI-MILITARY LEFT, COULD REKINDLE OLD SUSPICIONS ABOUT [[APRA’S|| 2]] TRUE COLORS. CONSIDERATION OF THIS FACTOR COULD WEIGH IN FAVOR OF THE [[TOWNSEND || 28]] "SHIFTING ALLIANCE" APPROACH.


7. AT THIS STAGE, IT IS TOO EARLY TO TELL WHICH OPTION [[APRA || 2]] WILL CHOOSE AND MUCH OF WHAT [[WE || 24]] ARE SEEING PROBABLY REPRESENTS PARTISAN POSTURING TO WIN [[APRA || 2]] THE BEST TERMS FOR ANY UNDERSTANDING [[IT || 2]] MAY EVENTUALLY CONCLUDE. NONETHELESS, [[THE PARTY  || 2]] MUST SOON MAKE A DECISION. THE [[JNE || 25]] HAS CALLED FOR THE OPENING OF  [[THE ASSEMBLY’S PREPARATORY COMMISSION ||26]] JULY 17. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT [[HAYA DE LA TORRE || 5]], WITH THE LARGEST SINGLE PREFERENTIAL VOTE, WILL CHAIR [[THAT COMMISSION ||26]]. AS TO [[THE ASSEMBLY ITSELF || 21]], HOWEVER [[IT || 21]] MUST FACE ON JULY 28TH THE QUESTION OF [[HAYA'S || 5] PRESIDENCY AS WELL AS OTHER BASIC ISSUES FOR WHICH A 51 VOTE MAJORITY WILL BE REQUIRED.
