1. AFTER REPORTEDLY STORMY DEBATE, [[INDEPENDENT LIBERAL PARTY (ILP) CENTRAL COMMITTEE || 1]] NOVEMBER 21 ADOPTED RESOLUTION (57-30) SPONSORED BY MINISTERS [[MOSHE KOL||2 ]] AND [[GIDEON HAUSNER|| 3]], RECOMMENDING FORMATION OF [[NATIONAL UNITY GOVERNMENT|| 4]] ON BASIS OF "OPEN OPTIONS FOR PEACE NEGOTIATIONS ON THE PREMISE OF TERRITORIAL COMPROMISE." IN SEPARATE VOTE, OVERWHELMING MAJORITY ADOPTED RESOLUTION CALLING FOR [[PALESINE||5 ]]-[[ARAB||6 ]] AUTONOMY" IN [[JUDEA|| 7]] AND [[SAMARIA|| 7]].


2. [[KOL|| 2]], IN EXPLAINING [[HIS|| 2]] SUPPORT FOR [[UNITY GOVERNMENT||4 ]] CONCEPT EMPHASIZED NEED FOR MAXIMUM NATIONAL UNITY IN WAKE OF [[RABAT|| 8]] CONFERNECE AND [[ARAFAT'S|| 9]] [[UN|| 10]] APPEARANCE. [[MK YEHUDA SHAANI|| 11]], WHO LED [[MINORITY OPPOSTION GROUP|| 12]], ARGUED THAT [[UNITY GOVERNEMTN|| 4]] WOULD PARALYZE [[GOI|| 13]] EFFORTS TO REACH NEGOTIATED POLITICAL SETTLEMENTS WITH [[ARAB STATES||6 ]].


4. IN CONTEXT OF MOUNTING PRESSURES FOR FORMATION OF ENLARGED [[GOVERNMENT|| 13]] (REFTEL, [[ILP|| 14]] DECISION IS FIRST CRACK IN POSITION OF PARTIES WHICH AVE SO FAR BEEN OPPOSED TO [[LIKUD|| 15]]-[[NRP|| 16]] EFFORTS TO BRING [[LIKUD|| 15]] INTO [[GOVERNMENT|| 13]]. WHILE [[ILP MINORITY || 14]] HAS FOAVORED [[UNITY GOVERNMENT|| 4]] SINCE DECEMBER 1973, ELECTION, [[KOL|| 2]] AND [[HAUSNER|| 3]] HAD THERETOFORE BEEN OPPOSED. [[WE|| 17]] HAVE BEEN TOLD BY USUALLY WELL-INFORMED JOURNALIST THAT WITH [[ITS|| 14]] EMPHASIS ON TERRITORIAL COMPROMISE, PURPOSE OF RESOLUTION WAS TO FORCE SPLIT BETWEEN [[[[BEGIN'S|| 18]] HERUT PARTY || 19]] AND OTHER MORE MODERATE ELEMENTS IN [[LIKUD||15 ]], WITH ONLYLATTER ENTERING [[THE GOVERNMENT|| 13]].


5. COMMENT: [[WE|| 17]] DO NOT BELIEVE THAT [[LIKUD|| 15]] IS ABOUT TO SPLIT UP, PARTICULARLY NOW THAT [[GOI|| 13]] NO LONGER FACES NEGOTIATIONS IN NEAR FUTURE OVER [[WEST BANK|| 7]]. BUT [[ILP || 14]] DECISION DOES GIVE ADDED WEIGHT TO [[LIKUD||15 ]]-[[NRP|| 16]] PRESSURES FOR ENLARGED [[GOVERNMENT|| 13]].
