1. [[DIRECTOR-GENERAL [[AMERICAN || 2]] AFFAIRS BUREAU (YAMAZAKI)|| 1]] PROVIDED [[GOJ||3]] RESPONSE TO [[OUR || 4]] REQUEST FOR EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR [[PANAMA || 5]] TREATIES LATE AFTERNOON SEPTEMBER 3. 


RESPONSE REFLECTS VIEWS OF ALL CONCERNED BUREAUS IN [[FONOFF || 11]] AND WAS REVIEWED BY [[FOREIGN MINISTER || 12]] AND [[VICE FOREIGN MINISTER ||13]]. MAJOR ELEMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:


A) AS OBSERVER TO [[OAS || 6]], [[GOJ ||3]] VALUES HIGHLY FACT THAT, AFTER LONG NEGOTIATIONS, [[US || 2]] AND [[ PANAMA  || 7]] HAVE ACHIEVED AGREEMENT. AS MAJOR USER OF [[CANAL || 8]], [[JAPAN  || 3]] BELIEVES NEW TREATIES WILL SIGNIFI- CANTLY INCREASE PROSPECTS FOR [[ITS || 3]] SECURE AND STABLE OPERATION.
B) ASSUMING [[AMBASSADOR [[TOGO  || 10]] ||9]]  IS INVITED TO SIGNING CEREMONY [[HE || 9]] WILL OF COURSE ATTEND. IN ADDITION, AS [[NATION  || 10]] WHOSE MAJOR INTERESTS ARE AFFECTED, [[JAPAN || 3]] WISHES IN "SOME FORM OR ANOTHER" TO EXPRESS [[ITS  || 3]] SATISFACTION WITH CONCLUSION OF TREATY.


C) HOWEVER, WITHOUT FURTHER INFORMATION, [[JAPAN || 3]] WOULD BE UNABLE TO SIGN A JOINT DECLARATION SUCH AS THE TENTATIVE DRAFT PROVIDED TO [[FONOFF || 11]] TODAY. SPECIFICALLY, [[JAPAN || 3]] WOULD WISH TO STUDY ACTUAL TEXTS OF BOTH TREATIES AS WELL AS TEXT OF "PROTOCOL" REFERRED TO IN LAST PARAGRAPH OF DRAFT DECLARATION. WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY FOR CAREFUL LEGAL ANALYSIS, [[JAPAN || 3]] COULD NOT SIGN DECLARATION OF SUPPORT. [[FONOFF || 11]] IS PREPARED TO EXAMINE DOCUMENTS ON URGENT BASIS IF THEY CAN BE PROVIDED.
D) IN ADDITION TO RECEIVING ALL BASIC DOCUMENTS, [[FONOFF || 11]] WISHES TO KNOW REACTION OF OTHER [[OAS||6]] OBSERVERS TO [[OUR ||2]] APPROACH.
E) [[JAPAN || 3]] IS PREPARED, HOWEVER, TO ISSUE UNILATERAL STATEMENT GIVING [[ITS || 3]] FULL SUPPORT TO [[PANAMA  || 5]] TREATIES. COMMENT: [[GOJ || 3]] HAS MADE MAJOR EFFORT TO PROVIDE AS RAPID AND FORTHCOMING A RESPONSE AS POSSIBLE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES. IF [[WE || 2]] WISH TO HAVE MORE THAN UNILATERAL STATEMENT OF SUPPORT, [[GOJ || 3]] WILL NEED TEXTS AND INFORMATION DESCRIBED IN SUBPARAS C) AND D) ABOVE.
