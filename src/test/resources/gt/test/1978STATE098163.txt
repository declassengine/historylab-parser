[[U.S. || 1]] CUSTOMS  || 2]]


1. ON APRIL 10 [[ARA/ECA || 15]] RECEIVED A DIPLOMATIC NOTE FROM [[AMBASSADOR LOPEZ ESCOBAR || 4]] SEEKING CLARIFICATION OF THE REASONS FOR AND PROTESTING THE TREATMENT ACCORDED [[MR. MIGUEL ANGEL NAPOUT || 5]] UPON [[HIS || 5]] ARRIVAL AT [[DULLES INTER- NATIONAL AIRPORT  || 6]] ON FRIDAY, MARCH 31.


2. THE GIST OF THE NOTE IS THAT [[MR. NAPOUT  || 5]] WAS TRAVEL- ING ON AN OFFICIAL PASSPORT (WITH B-2 VISA NO. 003781) AND UPON ARRIVAL WAS SUBJECTED TO A COMPLETE AND THOROUGH [[CUSTOMS  || 2]] SEARCH, PLUS AN INTERROGATION, QUOTE WITHOUT ANY NOTICE OR EXPLANATION FOR THIS SPECIAL, DEGRADING AND EMBARRASSING TREATMENT END QUOTE. THE SEARCH TOOK APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES, WHILE [[AMBASSADOR ESCOBAR || 4]] AND TWO OF [[[[HIS  || 4]] EMBASSY STAFF  || 7]] WAITED AT [[THE AIR- PORT ||6]] FOR [[MR. NAPOUT ||5]]. [[THE AMBASSADOR ||4]] SEEKS TO LEARN IF THIS TREATMENT WAS QUOTE IN SOME WAY CONNECTED WITH THE CONTINUING HARRASSMENT AND DEPRIVATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS INFLICTED ON [[MR. NAPOUT ||5]] AS A RESULT OF [[HIS || 5]] VOLUNTARY COOPERATION WITH [[THE [[U.S. || 1]] DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ||8 ]], [[DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION || 9]]. END QUOTE.


3. THE INITIAL REACTION TO THIS INCIDENT BY [[S/NM || 16]]  WAS THAT THE SEARCH WAS IN ERROR AND BASED ON AN OUTDATED SUSPECT LIST SUPPLIED TO [[CUSTOMS ||2]]. [[WE || 10]] ARE CHECKING WITH [[CUSTOMS || 2]]. SHOULD THIS PROVE CORRECT [[WE  || 10]] PROPOSE TO REPLY ALONG THESE LINES;


A) [[EXCELLENCY || 4]]: [[I  || 15]] HAVE THE HONOR TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECEIPT OF [[YOUR || 4]] NOTE OF APRIL 3, 1978 SEEKING CLARIFICA- TION OF THE REASONS FOR THE TREATMENT ACCORDED [[MR. MIGUEL ANGEL NAPOUT || 5]].
B) AS [[YOUR || 4]] NOTE INDICATES, [[YOU || 4]] ARE AWARE THAT FOR SEVERAL YEARS [[MR. NAPOUT || 5]] WAS UNDER SUSPICION AS A NARCOTICS SMUGGLER. THROUGH [[HIS || 5]] VOLUNTARY EFFORTS, INCLUDING A POLYGRAPH TEST, [[HE || 5]] HAS DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTHFULNESS OF [[HIS || 5]] ASSERTION THAT [[HE || 5]] WAS NOT INVOLVED IN SUCH SMUGGLING.
C) [[CUSTOMS AUTHORITIES || 2]] AT [[DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT || 6]] WERE UNAWARE OF [[MR. NAPOUT'S  || 5]] RECENT TEST. UNFORTUNATELY, [[MR. NAPOUT'S || 5]] NAME APPEARED ON AN OUTDATED LIST OF INDIVID- UALS ABOUT WHICH [[THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ||14]] MAINTAIN AN INTEREST. [[THE DEPARTMENT  || 10 ]] HAS BEEN IN CONTACT WITH [[THESE AGENCIES ||14]] SEEKING TO REMOVE [[MR. NAPOUT'S || 5]] NAME FROM THE NARCOTICS LISTING. [[WE ||15]] REGRET THE INCIDENT.
D) ACCEPT, [[EXCELLENCY || 4]], THE RENEWED ASSURANCES OF [[MY ||15]] HIGHEST CONSIDERATION.


4. PLEASE ADVISE IF THE PROPOSED ANSWER TO [[THE [[PARAGUAYAN  ||12 ]] EMBASSY  || 7]] NOTE PRESENTS ANY PROBLEMS.


5. ON APRIL 17 [[WE || 10]] WERE INFORMED BY [[THE DRUG ENFORCEMENT ADMINISTRATION || 9]] THAT [[NAPOUT'S || 5]] NAME WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE LOOK-OUT LIST.
