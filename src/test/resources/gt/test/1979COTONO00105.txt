1. [[MARTYS || 20]] DAY, JANUARY 16, WAS PREDICTABLY OCCASION FOR MORE LOUD BLAST AGAINST [[MERCENARIES  || 21]] AND [[BONGO || 1]]. BUT BY END OF CELEBRATION, NO ONE, INCLUDING [[PRESIDENT || 2]], SEEMED PARTICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT [[MERCENARIES  || 21]] OR PREOCCUPIED WITH ANY OTHER POLITICAL PROBLEM.


2. [[KEREKOU'S || 2]] SPEECH JANUARY 16 MARKING SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF 1977 " IMPERIALIST AGGRESSION" WAS ANOTHER REITERATION OF HOW [[MERCENARIES || 21]] LED BY [[BOB DENARD || 3]], ENCOURAGED BY [[MOROCCANS || 4]] AND [[GABON || 5]] CAME A CROPPER AGAINST VALIANT [[BENINESE || 6]] REVOLUTION. BANNERS CONDEMNED [[HASAN || 7]] AND [[BONGO || 1]]. [[KEREKOU || 2]] ACCUSED [[BONGO || 1]] OF ATROCI- TIES AGAINST [[BENINESE || 6]] EXPELLED FROM [[GABON || 8]] AND CITED [[THIRD WORLD || 9]] SUPPORT FOR [[BENIN || 6]]. [[HE  || 2]] PLEDGED SOLIDARITY WITH ALL WORLD LIBERATION MOVEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE IN [[SOUTHERN AFRICA ||10 ]], [[POLISARIO || 11]], [[SOUTH MOLUCCA || 12]] AND [[TIMOR || 13]].


3. APART FROM [[PRESIDENT'S || 2]] LONG DIATRIBE WHICH SAID NOTHING NEW, AND HAD MOST [[BENINESE  || 6]] SQUIRMING WITH BOREDOM DURING SECOND HALF HOUR IN HOT SUN, HIGHLIGHT OF DAY WAS OPENING OF [[STALINIST || 14]]- STYLE MONUMENT WHICH HOUSES [[MERCENARY ||21]] ARMORY AND IS TOPPED BY INSPIRATIONAL [[NORTH KOREAN  || 15]] BRONZE STATUE -- A SOLDIER, A PEASANT, AND AN AMAZON SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN DEFENSE OF THE COUNTRY. OSTENSIBLY SOLEMN MOOD OF OCCASION, SUPPOSED AFTER ALL TO HONOR THE DEAD OF JANUARY 16, 1977, WAS BROKEN FIRST BY [[KEREKOU'S || 2]] LOUD AND MEANDERING RHETORIC, THEN BY [[HIS  || 2]] GRANDSTANDING WITH CROWD AS [[HE || 2]] SURROUNDED [[HIMSELF || 2]] ON TRIBUNE WITH A WELL-KNOWN CRAZY WOMAN AND A [[BENINESE  || 6]] VETERAN OF FIRST WORLD WAR AND, FINALLY, BY A MILITARY PARADE WHICH ENDED INCONGRUOUSLY IN TRICK MOTOR CYCLE RIDING AND STOCK CAR ANTICS BY LOCAL MILITANTS.


4. OBVIOUSLY PLEASED WITH THE WAY THINGS HAD GONE IN THE MORNING, [[PRESIDENT || 2]] WAS IN EXPANSIVE MOOD AT EVENING COCKTAIL PARTY, DANCING WITH ANYONE [[HE || 2]] COULD GET [[HIS || 2]] HANDS ON, PULLING DIPLOMATIC CORPS INTO TRIBAL SNAKE DANCE TO DELIGHT OF [[BENINESE || 6]], OFFERING A SOLO EXHIBITION OF [[AFRICAN  ||16 ]] DRUMMING, AND AT TEN P.M. "ORDERING" ALL PRESENT, AS "DISCIPLINED [[MARXIST ||17 ]]-[[LENINIST || 14]]", TO DANCE UNTIL DAWN, THOUGH FOOD AND DRINK HAD RUN OUT. IN DEPARTING, [[PRESIDENT || 2]] GOT HIS BIGGEST CHEER OF THE DAY WITH REMARK THAT IN [[BENIN || 6]] [[MARXIST || 17]]-[[LENINISM || 14]] IS ADAPTED TO NEEDS OF LOCAL SITUATION."


5. COMMENT: IT WAS A DAY WHICH CAPSULIZED CONTRAST AND CONTRADICTIONS OF [[THIS EBULLIENT, NOMINALLY [[MARXIST || 17]] STATE  || 6]]. UNDUE SOLEMNITY AND SOCIALIST JARGON HAD BEEN HEAVY IN THE AIR AROUND SUCH RECENT MANIFESTATIONS AS NATIONAL DAY (NOVEMBER 30), ELABORATE MOURNING FOR [[BOUMEDIENNE || 18]], AND PRODUCTION FESTIVAL JANUARY 6. BUT IT IS HARD TO FIND A REAL CRISIS IN [[BENIN || 6]] THESE DAYS -- CROPS ARE GOOD, PLENTY OF MONEY IS BEING MADE ON THE MARGINS OF A [[STATE || 19]]-CONTROLLED ECONOMY, AND [[THE GOVERNMENT || 19]] FACES NO TANGIBLE INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL CHALLENGE. [[KEREKOU'S || 2]] RELAXED AND FINALLY FRENETIC EXPANSIVE MOOD ON [[MARTYRS  || 20]] DAY AND THE WAY [[BENINESE || 6]] WARMED TO THE OCCASION ONCE THE SPEECHES WERE OVER TELLS MORE ABOUT THE PREVAILLING POLITICAL CLIMATE THAN THE RED FLAGS NOW FLYING OVER BLEAK GRAY [[MARTYRS || 20]] MONUMENT IN [[COTONOU || 6]].
