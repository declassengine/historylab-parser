1. [[COLONEL FLETCHER || 1]] MET WITH [[COLONEL MOJICA || 2]] EVENING OF 7 JULY TO CONVEY POINTS IN REF TEL. [[HE  || 2]] UNDERSTOOD WHY [[HE   || 2]] COULD NOT BE GIVEN MORE CERTAIN ANSWER ON HOW [[HE || 2]] WOULD FIGURE IN [[NEW GOVERNMENT || 3]].


2. RE OTHER NAMES BEING CONSIDERED. [[MOJICA  || 2]] KNOWS [[GENERAL GUTIERREZ  || 4]] BUT NOT WELL, BECAUSE THE LATTER HAS BEEN OUT OF [[NICARAGUA || 5]] FOR A LONG TIME, AS [[MIL ATT IN [[WASHINGTON || 6]]  || 4]] FROM 1970 - 1977 AND NOW AS [[AMBASSADOR TO [[JAPAN || 7]] || 4]]. [[MOJICA || 2]] IS A VERY CLOSE FRIEND OF [[GENERAL ORLANDO GUERRERO || 8]], A FRIENDSHIP DATING BACK TO 1953 - 1956 WHEN BOTH WERE TOGETHER FOR THREE YEARS IN [[VENEZUELA || 9]] IN SCHOOL AND IN THE SAME [[VENEZUELAN  || 10]] ARTILLERY UNIT. [[GUERRERO  || 8]] IS NOW [[COMMANDER OF [[THE DEPARTMENT OF ZELAYA ||5 ]] || 8]]. (CAPITAL CITY IS [[BLUEFIELDS || 5]]).


3. RE NAMES IDENTIFIED IN REFTEL AS PROPOSED BY [[SANDINISTAS || 11]]; [[MOJICA || 2]] KNOWS BOTH [[COLONEL LARIOS || 12]] AND [[COLONEL MENDIETA || 13]] BUT NOT INTIMATELY. [[LATTER|| 13]] IS A DENTIST AND NOW IN [[COSTA RICA || 14]], AFTER BEING IMPRISONED BY [[SOMOZA || 15]]. [[MOJICA || 2]] DOES NOT KNOW [[MAJOR ESPINAL || 16]].


4. [[MOJICA || 2]] IS THINKING OF WAYS TO COMMUNICATE WITH FRIENDS AND RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF CONVEYING HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, [[MOJICA || 2]] SAID IT WAS MOST DIFFICULT BECAUSE [[HIS || 2]] FRIENDS ARE DISPERSED THROUGHOUT [[THE COUNTRY || 5]] AND [[HE  || 2]] UNDERSTANDS SECURITY IN GARRISONS IS TIGHT. AT SUGGESTION OF [[THE CHARGE || 17]], [[DATT || 18]] RAISED POSSIBILITY OF USING [[USG  || 19]] FACILITIES IN [[MANAGUA || 5]] AS CONDUIT. [[MOJICA || 2]] WAS RECEPTIVE BUT WISHES TO THINK MATTER OUT, AS [[HE || 2]] WAS UNCERTAIN THAT [[USG || 19]] INTERMEDIARY WOULD BE SECURE. [[FLETCHER || 1]] ASSURED [[MOJICA || 2]] THAT IF [[HE || 2]] CHOSE TO USE THIS CONDUIT IT WOULD BE SECURE.


5. [[MOJICA || 2]] EXPLAINED HE HAS BEEN VERY BUSY IN RECENT DAYS WITH [[GENERAL SANCHEZ || 20]], AN ALMOST DAILY VISITOR FROM [[MANAGUA || 5]]. MOST RECENTLY, [[SANCHEZ || 20]] DEPARTED [[GUATEMALA  || 21]] PM OF 7 JULY AND WILL RETURN PM 8 JUL.


6. [[MOJICA || 2]] WENT ON TO SAY THAT [[HE  || 2]] HAS NOT BEEN KEPT INFORMED, BUT KNOWS THAT [[SANCHEZ  || 20]] HAS MET WITH [[PRESIDENT LUCAS || 22]], [[GENERAL SPIEGELER || 23]] AND [[COLONEL SANDOVAL || 24]] (ARMY G-4-LOGISTICS AND [[RECENTLY NAMED VICE CHIEF OF STAFF ||24]]). RECENT MEETINGS WITH [[SANDOVAL || 24]] HAVE INCLUDED A [[(FNU) DELAMICO || 25]], REPORTEDLY A [[MIAMI || 6]] BASED [[U.S. || 6]] CITIZEN OF [[CUBAN || 26]] ORIGIN WHO DEALS IN ARMS. [[DELAMICO || 25]] ALSO HAS AN OFFICE [[HERE|| 5]]. [[MOJICA || 2]] SAID [[HE ||2 ]] BELIVES THAT UNTIL RECENTLY, [[GOG ||27 ]] SUPPORT TO [[SOMOZA || 15]] HAS BEEN CONFINED TO AMMUNITION. [[HE || 2]] IS AWARE THAT ITEMS ARE BEING MOVED FROM [[THE SAN JOSE AIR BASE  || 28]] IN [[GUATEMLA   || 21]] TO [[MANAGUA  || 5]] USING GN AND LANICA AIRPLANES. [[MOJICA || 2]] BELIEVES THAT RECENT INCLUSION OF [[DELAMICO ||25 ]] IN [[SANCHEZ ||20 ]] - [[SANDOVAL ||24 ]] MEETINGS INDICATES SUPPORT IS GOING BEYOND AMMUNITION AND MAY INCLUDE ARMS. ONE OF PLACES MENTIONED AS A SUPPLIER-VIA-[[GUATEMALA || 21]] WAS [[PORTUGAL || 29]] (ALSO MENTIONED TO [[CHARGE || 17]] AS SOURCE OF ARMS FOR [[GUATEMALA || 21]] BY [[MINISTER OF FINANCE BUCARO || 30]]).


7. [[MOJICA || 2]] WILL PROVIDE [[FLETCHER  || 1]] WITH COMPLETE BIO DATA JULY 8 PM WHICH WILL BE FORWARDED BY SEPTEL.


8. IN RESPONSE TO [[DATT'S || 18]] QUESTION [[MOJICA || 2]] SAID [[SOMOZA || 15]] WOULD REMAIN IN OFFICE FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL WEEKS, PROVIDED THAT RE-SUPPLY CONTINUES.
