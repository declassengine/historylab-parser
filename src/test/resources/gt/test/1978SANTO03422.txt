C. [[SANTO DOMINGO || 1]] 3355


1. THE HEARINGS BY [[THE CENTRAL ELECTORAL COMMISSION (JCE)  ||2 ]] ON [[REFORMISTA  || 3]] CHALLENGES TO THE ELECTORAL RESULTS OF MAY 16 CONTINUED JUNE 21. TO DATE [[THEHOJCE || 2]] HAS HEARD CHALLENGES TO THE RESULTS IN 30 MUNICIPALITIES, WITH 16 MORE TO FOLLOW. ABSENT AT THE HEARINGS TODAY WERE THE DECORUM AND COURTESY THAT HAD CHARACTERIZED THE FIRST TWO DAYS OF HEARINGS (REFS A AND B). THE DEBATES TURNED INTO AN UGLY POLITICAL CONFRONTATION WITH [[REFORMISTAS || 3]] AND [[PRD  || 4]] TRADING CHARGES AND ACCUSATIONS.


2. THE TONE WAS SET BY [[[[REFORMISTA || 3]] LEGAL EXPERT "VINCHO" CASTILLO || 5]]. AFTER REPEATING [[HIS || 5]] USUAL ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF "COMPLEMENTARY ELECTIONS", [[CASTILLO || 5]] LAUNCHED A BLISTERING ATTACK ON [[[[PRD  || 4]] SECGEN PENA GOMEZ || 6]]. [[THE [[PRD || 4]] SECGEN ||6]] HAD ACCUSED [[CASTILLO ||5]] THE DAY BEFORE OF TAKING PART IN THE WEEKEND BREAIN INTO [[JCE || 2]] HEADQUARTERS IN WHICH A NUMBER OF VOTER REGISTRATION CARDS AND DOCUMENTS WERE STOLEN (REF C).


3. [[CASTILLO|| 5]] PRODUCED A TAPE RECORDER AND BEGAN TO PALY A TAPED TELEPHOONE CONVERSATION OF MAY 23. AT THIS POINT [[[[JCE || 2]]  INTERIM CHAIRMAN HUGO VARGAS SUBERVI || 7]] ASKED [[CASTILLO|| 5]] NOT TO PLAY THE TAPE AT THE HEARINGS, THAT [[HE ||7]] COULD SUBMIT IT TO [[THE COMMISSION || 12]] LATER. [[CASTILLO|| 5]] AGREED, BUT READ THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE CONVERSATION ANYWAY. THE CONVERSATION WAS BETWEEN [[[[PRD || 4]] PARTY PRESIDENT AND REPRESENTATIVE AT THE [[JCE || 2]]  HEARINGS SALVADOR JORGE BLANCO  || 8]]  AND A [[MR MARCANO || 9]]. THE MAIN [[REFORMISTA || 3]] ACCUSATION BASED ON THE TAPE COMES FROM THE PORTION IN WHICH [[MARCANO || 9]] TELLS [[JORGE  || 8]] THAT [[THEY|| 10]] MUST GET IN TOUCH WITH [[THEIR|| 10]] "KEY CONTACT" IN THE [[JCE || 2]]  IN ORDER TO PREVENT A PLOT BY [[REFORMISTAS || 3]] TO HAVE [[THEMSELVES||3]]  DELCARED WINNERS OF [[NAGUA PROVINCE ||1]] (WHERE [[THE PRD || 4]] WON). [[CASTILLO|| 5]] SAID THAT THE [["KEY CONTACT"  || 11]] REFERRED TO IN THE CONVERSATION IS [[FELIPE CABRERA FEBRILLET || 11]], THE [[[[JCE || 2]]  COMPUTER EXPERT  || 11]] WHO WAS DETAINED BY POLICE APPARENTLY ON GROUNDS THAT THE [[JCE || 2]]  COMPUTERIZED REGISTRATION LISTS WERE MANIPULATED TO PREVENT [[[[REFORMISTA || 3]] VOTERS  || 12]] FROM EXERCISING [[THEIR||12]] RIGHT TO VOTE ON MAY 16.


4. NEXT IT WAS [[SALVADOR JORGE BLANCO'S || 8]] TURN TO SPEAK, AND [[HE || 8]] DEPLORED THE FACT THAT [[THE REFORMISTAS || 3]] HAD STOOPED SO LOW AS TO USE PHONE TAPS. DECLARING THAT "PRIVACY NO LONGER EXISTS IN [[THIS COUNTRY || 1]]," [[JORGE || 8]], NEVERTHELESS, EXPLAINED THE PHONE CONVERSATION. THE [[MILITARY ||13]] INTERVENTION IN [[THE JCE || 2]]  IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF MAY 17 HAD PLACED [[THE PRD || 4]] "ON THE ALERT" AND FORCED [[PRD LEADERS || 4]] TO JEALOUSLY GUARD [[THEIR || 4]] VOTE TOTALS; THIS IS WHAT THE CONVERSATION WITH [[MARCANO || 9]] HAD BEEN ABOUT. AFTER MORE CHARGES WERE TRADED, [[THE JCE || 2]]  ADJOURNED UNTIL TOMORROW, WHEN THE LAST 16 CHALLENGES WILL BE CONSIDERED.
