1. [[EMBASSY'S || 1]] REQUEST FOR WTD INFO MAILED TO [[SUBJECT FIRM'S|| 3]] ADDRESS UNANSWERED, LIKEWISE [[EMBASSY'S|| 1]] ATTEMPTS TO REACH [[[[FIRM'S|| 3]] OWNER || 2]] WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. ACCORDING TO INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM LOCAL BANKING AND BUSINESS SOURCES, [[SUBJECT FIRM|| 3]] WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1956 AS A SOLE OWNERSHIP OF [[ANTRANIK KIRDBJIAN || 2]] UNDER THE NAME OF [[VOLCAN FACTORY|| 3]]. [[FIRM|| 3]] OWNED AND OPERATED A PLANT FOR PRODUCTION AND SALE OF THE ALCOHOLIC DRINK "ARAK", WINES AND ALCOHOLS. IN 1960 [[FIRM|| 3]] DECLARED BANKRUPTCY. SINCE THEN, LOCAL BANKS HAVE DEALT WITH [[FIRM|| 3]] CAUTIOUSLY, ALTHOUGH [[FIRM’S || 3]] ASSETS IN REAL ESTATE AND MACHINERY ARE ESTIMATED TO BE OVER 1,500,000 [[LEBANESE|| 4]] POUNDS. SAME SOURCES ADDED THAT DURING 1975-76 CIVIL HOSTILITIES IN [[LEBANON|| 4]], [[ANTRANIK ||2]] FROZE [[HIS||2]] BUSINESS BUT RESUMED ON A SMALLER LEVEL IN 1979. IN 1978 [[FIRM|| 3]] FROZE [[ITS|| 3]] BUSINESS AGAIN FOR SECURITY REASONS; [[KIRDBJIAN'S ||2]] PLANT IS LOCATED IN [[SIN EL-FIL|| 4]], ONE OF [[BEIRUT'S || 4]] HEAVILY DAMAGED SUBURBS. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN [[SIN EL-FIL|| 4]] AND [[WEST BEIRUT|| 4]] ARE STILL DIFFICULT AND COMMERCIAL LIFE IN THE DAMAGED EASTERN AREAS REMAINS DISRUPTED. IN VIEW OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE, STRICT TRADE PRECAUTIONS WOULD BE ADVISABLE.
