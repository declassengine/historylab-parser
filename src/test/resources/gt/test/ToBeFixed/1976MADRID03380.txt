1. THERE HAS BEEN MUCH SPECULATION AND CERTAIN FEAR THAT MAY DAY THIS YEAR COULD TAKE A SOMEWHAT UGLY TURN WITH ATTEMPTS BY [[OPPOSITION LABOR AND POLITICAL GROUPS ||22]] TO STAGE DEMONSTRATIONS.


2. RE STRIKE ACTIVITY, THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CONVOCATIONS IN [[MADRID || 1]] AND ELSEWHERE FOR STRIKES IN CONSTRUCTION AND METALLURGICAL FIELDS FOR APRIL 29 AND 30 (MAY 1 ITSELF IS A HOLIDAY), WITH PROSPECT OF MINOR STRIKE SUCCESS IN CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. IN GENERAL, HOWEVER, STRIKE ACTIVITY HAS ABATED IN PAST MONTH CONTRARY TO PLANS OF SOME CLANDESTINE LABOR ORGS WHICH WANTED LARGE SCALE LABOR AGITATION TO PRECEDE MASSIVE MAY DAY TURNOUT.


3. REPORTEDLY, HOWEVER, [[PCE  || 2]] HOPES FOR MASSIVE JOINT [[OPPOSITION ||22]] ACTIONS AMY 1 BY THE "[[PLATAJUNTA  || 3]]", [[PCE-DOMINATED SWC || 4]], [[SOCIALIST UGT || 5]], AND [[SOCIAL CHRISTIAN USO || 6]], BROKE DOWN AND HAD TO BE ABANDONED, DUE TO DISAGREEMENT AMONG VARIOUS [[OPPOSITION GROUPS ||22]] AND PARTICULARLY TO UNWILLINGNESS OF [[SOCIALIST UGT || 5]] AND [[PSOE || 7]] TO PARTICIPATE. IN SOME PROVINCIAL CITIES, HOWEVER, JOINT ACTIONS OF [[OPPOSITION GROUPS||22]]  ARE STILL PLANNED. IN [[MADRID || 1]], EACH ILLEGAL TRADE UNION IS NOW REPORTEDLY PLANNING TO CELEBRATE MAY 1. WITH THEIR OWN COMMEMORATIVE ACTS, MOSTLY OF AN INDOOR NATURE.


4. [[PSOE || 7]] AND [[UGT  || 5]] PLAN TO HOLD COMMEMORATIVE ACT ON MAY 1 IN [[MADRID || 1]] MOVIE THEATRE TO WHICH THEY HAVE ALSO INVITED OTHER POLITICCAL AND TRADE UNION GROUPS CLAIMING [[SOCIALIST || 8]] LABEL, INCLUDING [[USO || 6]], [[[[PROFESSOR TIERNO GALVAN'S || 9]] PSP || 10]], AND [["OLDGUARD- HISTORIC" PSOE FACTION || 7]], IN A SHOW OF [[SPANISH || 1]] [[SOCIALIST || 8]] SOLIDARITY. [[UGT  || 5]] AND [[PSOE ||7 ]] ALSO PLAN TO SEND SMALL REPRESENTATATIVE DELEGATION TO [[MADRID'S || 1]] CIVIL CEMETERY MAY 1 TO LAY FLOWERS ON TOMB OF [[PABLO IGLESIAS || 11]], [[OUNDER 100 YEARS AGO OF BOTH [[SOCIALIST PSOE || 7]] AND [[UGT ||5 ]] ||11 ]], ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE SOME FEAR [[POLICE ||21]] MAY SEEK TO CLOSE CEMETERY AND REFUSE ENTRANCE JUST AS THEY DID LAST YEAR ON MAY 1.


5. [[USO ||6 ]] ALSO PLANS [[ITS || 6]] OWN COMMEMORATIVE ACT INSIDE A [[MADRID || 1]] SCHOOL ON MAY 1, AND [[PCE-DOMINATED SWC || 4]] REPORTEDLY PLANS TO HOLD AN INDOOR COMMEMORATIVE RALLY OF ITS OWN MILITANTS, EITHER AT ANOTHER SCHOOL OR IN [[MADRID’S || 1]] SPORTS PALACE. [[PCE||2]] AND [[SWC ||4]] HAVE ALSO REPORTEDLY CONVOKED A FAMILY-TYPE GATHERING OF THEIR MILITANTS AND THEIR WIVES AND CHILDREN IN [[MADRID'S || 1]] [[CASA DE CAMPO PARK||13]]. ONE [[EMBASSY ||12]] SOURCE POINTED OUT THAT THIS REPRESENTS PROPAGANDA MANEUVER WHICH WILL ENABLE [[PCE||2]] AND [[SEC||4]] TO SUBSEQUENTLY FALSELY CLAIM MASSIVE TURNOUT FOR THEIR FAMILY-STYLE CONVOCATION, INASMUCH AS [[CASA DE CAMPO ||13]] IS NORMALLY JAMMED WITH THOUSANDS OF PICNICKING [[MADRID || 1]] FAMILIES ON ANY HOLIDAY AFTERNOON.


6. [[GOVT|| 14]] HAS INDICATED SOME APPREHENSION OVER POSSIBLE MAY DAY DEMONSTRATIONS AND DISORDERS, BY MAKING ARRESTS OF EXTREMISTS IN DIFFERENT CITIES AS WELL AS BY ALLEGING, A WEEK AGO, THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF EXTREMISTS WERE IN [[PORTUGAL || 15]] PREPARING TO INFILTRATE [[SPAIN || 1]] WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF CAUSING DISORDERS ON MAY 1. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT [[GOS || 14]] ASSESSMENT IS THAT THERE WILL BE NO SERIOUS DISTURBANCES IN [[MADRID || 1]] ON MAY 1. ON APR 27 [[GOVT || 14]] ANNOUNCED [[IT || 14]] WOULD NOT AUTHORIZE NOR TOLERATE ANY PUBLIC MANIFESTATIONS ON MAY 1 OR PRECEDING DAYS. [[OPPOSITION GROUPS||22]]  HAVE INTERPRETED [[GOVT'S || 14]] STATEMENT AS A BAN ON ANY STREET DEMONSTRATIONS BUT ARE GOING AHEAD WITH THEIR PLANS FOR INDOOR COMMEMORATIVE ACTS ON THEORY THAT THEY ARE NOT PUBLIC MANIFESTATION (BUT RATHER ARE "PRIVATE") AND THAT IN ANY EVENT THEIR RESPECTIVE TROUPS MUST PEACEFULLY CELEBRATE MAY 1 IN SOME MANNER.


7. [[[[GOVT || 14]]-CONTROLLED [[SPANISH || 1]] SYNDICAL ORGANIZATION (SSO) || 16]], WHICH FOR PAST 20 YEARS HAS ALWAYS STAGED GYMNASTICS EXHIBITION BEFORE [[LATE GENERAL FRANCO  || 17]] AND 80,000 SPECTATORS IN [[MADRID'S || 1]] LARGEST FOOTBALL STADIUM, PRUDENTLY DECIDED NOT TO HOLD THIS TRADITIONAL EVENT, ALTHOUGH SOME SMALLER [[SSO || 16]]-SPONSORED EXHIBITIONS ARE STILL GOING TO TAKE PLACE IN SOME PROVINCIAL CAPITALS. (NOTE: AT LAST YEAR'S [[MADRID || 1]] [[SSO  || 16]] MASS GYMNASTICS RALLY, A BOMB BLEW UP A PARKED CAR OUTSIDE THE STADIUM ONLY 15 MINUTES AFTER [[FRANCO  || 17]] HAD PASSED BY, ALTHOUGH MIRACULOUSLY NO ONE WAS HURT.)


8. COMMENT: WITH NEITHER [[GOVT  || 14]] NOR [[MAJOR OPPOSITION GROUPS ||22]] PLANNING MASSIVE STREET MANIFESTATIONS, PRINCIPAL DANGER OF STREET CLASHES AND VIOLENCE COMES FROM EXTREMIST LEFTIST GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, EVER-VOLATILE [[BASQUE COUNTRY ||18 ]], WHERE SEVERAL CHURCHES HAVE SCHEDULED MASSES TO COMMEMORATE WORKERS KILLED IN [[VITORIA || 1]] TWO MONTHS AGO, ALSO CONTAINS SOME POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE. (POSSIBILITY OF SOME [[ETA  || 19]] TERRORIST ACT ALSO CANNOT BE RULED OUT). [[GOVT || 14]] IS EXPECTED TO HAVE EXTENSIVE DEPLOYMENT OF [[POLICE AND SECURITY FORCES || 21]] BUT VIOLENCE COULD ALSO RESULT SHOULD [[POLICE|| 21]] SEEK TO BREAK UP SOME OF INDOOR COMMEMORA- TIVE ACTS OF [[OPPOSITION TRADE UNION AND POLITICAL GROUPS ||22]], ALTHOUGH IT CLEAR THAT BOTH [[DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL AND TRADE UNION OPPOSITION GROUPS ||22]] AS WELL AS  [[PCE||2]] ARE VERY ANXIOUS TO AVOID ANY TYPE VIOLENCE INASMUCH AS THEY BELIEVE A VIOLENT MAY 1 MARKED BY DISORDERS WOULD NOT FAVOR THEIR INTERESTS AT THIS TIME. (SOME OBSERVERS, HOWEVER, BELIEVE  [[PCE||2]] MIGHT BE PLAING A DOUBLE GAME BY FAVORING PEACEFUL INDOOR ACTIVITIES ON THE ONE HAND, WHILE EGGING ON LEFTIST EXTREMISTS TO PROVOKE INCIDENTS ON THE OTHER.)
