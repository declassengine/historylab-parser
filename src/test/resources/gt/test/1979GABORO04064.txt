1. (C) ENTIRE TEXT.


2. UPON RECEIPT OF REFTEL A, ON NOVEMBER 16, [[I || 2]] TELEPHONED [[THE PERMANENT SECRETARY FOR EXTERNAL AFFAIRS || 1]], [[LEBANG MPOTOKWANE || 1]], AND PROVIDED [[HIM|| 1]] WITH THE CURRENT INFORMATION ON THE CONDITION OF [[THE HOSTAGES || 3]]. [[MPOTOKWANE || 1]] EXPRESSED HORROR AND CONCERN AT [[THE HOSTAGES'|| 3]] PLIGHT.


3. [[I || 2]] ASKED [[MPOTOKWANE || 1]] IF THERE WAS ANY WAY [[HIS GOVERNMENT || 4]] COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE. [[HE|| 1]] SAID THAT UNFORTUNATELY THERE WAS NOT. [[BOTSWANA || 5]] IS ONLY REPRESENTED IN [[THE U.S. || 6]], [[U.K. || 7]], [[ZAMBIA || 8]] AND [[BELGIUM || 9]] ([[EEC || 10]]) AND AT [[THE UN || 11]]. THE [[GOB || 4]] HAS NO CONTACTS WITH [[IRANIAN OFFICIALS || 12]].


4. [[I|| 2]] ALSO TELEPHONED ON NOVEMBER 16 [[MR. SHER KHAN ||13 ]], ONE OF THE LEADERS OF [[[[GABORONE  || 5]] MOSLEM COMMUNITY || 14]], TO DETERMINE WHETHER LOCAL [[MOSLEMS || 14]] (WHO ARE ALMOST TOTALLY OF [[INDIAN || 15]] AND [[PAKISTANI || 16]] ORIGIN) HAD ANY CONTACT WITH [[IRANIANS || 17]]. [[MR. KHAN || 13]] TOLD ME THAT NEITHER [[HIS  || 13]] COMMUNITY NOR ANY OTHER [[MOSLEM COMMUNITY || 14]] IN [[BOTSWANA || 5]] HAD ANY CONTACT WITH [[IRAN || 17]].


5. [[I|| 2]] RECEIVED REFTEL B ON NOVEMBER 18 BUT WAS NOT ABLE TO REACH [[MPOTOKWANE || 1]] UNTIL THIS MORNING (NOVEMBER 19). ([[I  || 2]] ALSO TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO REACH [[MINISTER OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MOGWE || 18]], WHO ONLY RETURNED TO [[BOTSWANA || 5]], FROM A TRIP TO [[MALAWI || 19]], ON NOVEMBER 17.) [[I|| 2]] STRESSED TO [[MPOTOKWANE || 1]] THE URGENCY IN VIEW OF THE [[IRANIAN || 12]] ANNOUNCEMENT THAT [[THE HOSTAGES || 3]] WOULD BE TRIED FOR ESPIONAGE AND THE ADVENT OF THE NOVEMBER 21 HOLIDAY PERIOD. [[I|| 2]] SUGGESTED THAT EVEN THOUGH [[BOTSWANA  || 5]] HAD NO TIES WITH [[IRAN || 17]], [[THE GOB || 4]] COULD NEVER- THELESS EXPRESS [[ITS || 4]] CONCERN OVER THE [[HOSTAGE || 3]] SITUATION, IF NOT FOR THE SAKE OF [[THE [[AMERICANS || 6]] INVOLVED || 3]], THEN BECAUSE OF THE DANGEROUS PRECEDENT BEING SET WHICH COULD AFFECT EVERY NATION. [[I|| 2]] ADDED THAT IF A LARGE NUMBER OF THE [[NON-ALIGNED NATIONS || 20]] WERE TO DO THIS, IT MIGHT HAVE SOME EFFECT ON [[THE IRANIAN LEADERSHIP || 12]].


6. [[MPOTOKWANE || 1]] EXPRESSED DOUBT THAT [[THIS GOVERNMENT || 4]] WOULD MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT BUT [[HE || 1]] SAID [[HE  || 1]] WOULD TALK TO [[MINISTER MOGWE || 18]] ABOUT IT.
