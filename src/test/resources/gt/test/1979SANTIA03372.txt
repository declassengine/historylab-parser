RESPONSE TO [[US || 1]] REACTION ON DENIAL OF EXTRADITION
FOLLOWING IS UNOFFICIAL [[EMBASSY || 2]] TRANSLATION OF [[GOC || 3]] STATE- MENT RELEASED MAY 15:
BEGIN QUOTE:
REGARDING THE STATEMENT OF [[THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE OF [[THE UNITED STATES || 1]] || 4]] ABOUT THE SITUATION STEMMING FROM THE EXTRADITION PROCEEDINGS, [[THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS  || 5]] DECLARES:


1. WHEN [[THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT  || 1]] DECIDED TO PLACE THIS CASE BEFORE THE COMPETENT [[[[CHILEAN  || 3]] COURTS || 11]] IN CONFORMITY WITH INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN THE EXTRADITION TREATY SIGNED BY [[BOTH GOVERNMENTS  || 6]] IN 1902, [[ IT || 1]]  RECOGNIZED AND ACCEPTED THE JURISDICTION ("COMPETENCIA") OF [[THESE JUDICIAL BODIES || 11]] .


2. IN THIS FIRST STEP OF THE PROCEDURE, [[THE PRESI- DENT OF [[THE SUPREME COURT || 8]]  ||7 ]], EXERCISING [[HIS || 7]] LEGAL ATTRIBUTES, HAS ISSUED A WELL-FOUNDED DECISION DENYING THE EXTRADITIONS. THERE- FORE, IT IS NOTT UP TO [[THE CHILEAN GOVERNMENT || 3]], AND EVEN LESS ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT, TO TRY TO INTERVENE IN THE DECISIONS OF [[THE JUDICIAL BRANCH || 11]]  WHICH, AS ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF [[THE STATE || 3]], IS INDEPENDENT AND AUTONOMOUS.SGOING EVEN FURTHER, INTERVENTION ON THE EVE OF AN APPEAL OF THAT DECISION IS INTOLERABLE AND UNACCEPTABLE.


3. [[THIS MINISTRY  || 5]] BELIEVES IT USEFUL TO SPECIFY THE FOLLOWING:
(A) [[CHILEAN  || 3]] FOREIGN POLICY RESTS FUNDAMENTALLY ON THE RESPECT FOR TREATIES. ONE OF THEM IS THE EXTRADI- TION TREATY OF 1902, BETWEEN [[THIS COUNTRY  || 3]] AND [[THE UNITED STATES || 1]]; AND,
(B) ALTHOUGH [[THE MINISTRY'S  || 5]] SURPRISE AND DISPLEASURE WITH THE STYLE AND BASICALLY THREATENING ESSENCE OF THE ([[DEPARTMENT OF STATE || 4]]) DECLARATION MUST BE MADE CLEAR, [[THE MINISTRY  || 5]] NOTES THAT [[THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES || 1]], BY ANNOUNCING [[ITS || 1]] INTENT TO APPEAL THE DECISION, IS ONCE AGAIN RECOGNIZING THE COMPETENCE OF THE [[[[CHILEAN  || 3]] JUDICIAL SYSTEM || 11]].


4. IT IS HOPED THAT THE CONSULTATIONS UPON WHICH [[AMBASSADOR LANDAU || 9]] HAS BEEN CALLED AND THE ANNOUNCED REVIEW OF BILATERAL RELATIONS WILL ALSO PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT AN END TO ALL THE DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES OF WHICH [[CHILE ||3]] HAS BEEN A VICTIM AND WHICH NOW INCLUDE THIS PRESSURE ON [[THE JUDICIAL BRANCH || 11]]. 5. FINALLY, [[THE GOVERNMENT OF CHILE || 3]] MUST STATE THAT [[IT || 3]] DOES NOTT ACCEPT, NOR WILL [[IT|| 3]] ACCEPT, ANY THREAT THAT AFFECTS [[ITS|| 3]] SOVEREIGNTY AND NATIONAL DIGNITY.


END QUOTE.
