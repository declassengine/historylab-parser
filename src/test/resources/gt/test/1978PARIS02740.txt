1. SUMMARY: INFORMATION CONTAINED IN REFTEL DELIVERED TO [[FOREIGN MINISTER ||1]]. [[HE ||1]] WELCOMED THE NEWS OF [[SADAT'S ||2]] VISIT AND RESTATED VIGOROUSLY [[FRENCH ||3]] VIEWS ON IMPORTANCE TO [[EUROPE ||4]] OF [[MIDDLE EAST  ||5]] SOLUTION WHICH WILL SATISFY [[[[PALESTINIAN || 6]] MODERATES ||7]], A SOLUTION WHICH ONLY [[THE USG ||8]] CAN BRING ABOUT BY MOVING [[ISRAELIS ||9]] FORWARD. END SUMMARY.


2. [[FOREIGN MINISTER GUIRINGAUD ||1]] AND [[ACTING DIRECTOR [[MIDDLE EAST  ||5]] AFFAIRS SERVANT || 10]] RECEIVED [[CHARGE  ||11]] PROMPTLY AND WELCOMED REFTEL INFORMATION REGARDING [[SADAT  ||2]] TRIP WHICH [[GUIRINGAUD ||1]] SAID [[HE ||1]] WOULD CONVEY TO [[PRESIDENT GISCARD || 12]]. [[FOREIGN MINISTER || 1]] ASKED IF THERE WERE ANY INDICATIONS THAT [[ISRAELIS || 9]] WERE PREPARED TO ACCEPT [[ASWAN || 13]] FORMULA ON ROLE OF [[PALESTINIANS || 6]] IN DETERMINING [[THEIR || 6]] FUTURE AND RECEIVED REPLY THAT [[EMBASSY || 14]] DID NOT HAVE ANY RECENT INFORMATION TO THIS EFFECT.


3. [[GUIRINGAUD || 1]] THEN DELIVERED AN UNUSUALLY EMOTIONAL RESTATEMENT OF [[FRENCH || 3]] VIEWS, CONVEYED TO [[PRESIDENT CARTER || 15]] AND [[SECRETARY VANCE  || 16]] DURING THEIR RECENT [[NORMANDY  || 17]] TRAIN TRIP. [[HE || 1]] STRESSED THAT EXCLUSION OF [[THE PALESTINIANS || 6]] PREOCCUPIES [[GOF || 3]]; ANY SETTLEMENT THAT DOES SO MAY HAVE A TRANSITORY EXISTENCE OF A FEW MONTHS OR EVEN A YEAR OR TWO, BUT WILL NOT ENDURE. [[PRESIDENT GISCARD || 12]] AND [[GUIRINGAUD || 1]] BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF [[EUROPE || 4]] DEPENDS ON A [[MIDDLE EAST || 5]] SOLUTION. FAILURE WILL BRING [[THE SOVIETS || 18]] BACK IN AND WOULD PRODUCE AN ENERGY FAMINE WHICH WOULD PUT IN QUESTION THE INDEPENDENCE OF [[EUROPE || 4]]. 


4. [[GUIRINGAUD || 1]] CONTINUED THAT [[GISCARD  || 12]] AND [[HE  || 1]] SEE THE INDISPENSABILITY OF BRINGING THE NECESSARY PRESSURE ON [[ISRAEL  || 9]] TO ACCEPT A REASONABLE SETTLEMENT WHICH [[[[PALESTINIAN || 6]] MODERATES || 7]] CAN LIVE WITH, WHICH WILL DISARM THE CRITICAL MASS OF [[PALESTINIANS || 6]]. [[HE  || 1]] NOTED THAT [[PALESTINIANS  || 6]] ARE EVERYWHERE IN [[THE GULF GOVERNMENTS  || 19]] AND A FORMIDABLE PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION OF SUCH STATES AS [[KUWAIT || 20]].


5.  [[GUIRINGAUD || 1]] OUTLINED A MODERATE SOLUTION AS ONE WHICH WOULD PLACE [[THE WEST BANK  || 21]] UNDER INTERNATIONAL CONTROL WITH A FREE CHOICE BY ITS RESIDENTS OF THEIR FUTURE, TO BE MADE WITHIN FOUR OR FIVE YEARS. [[HE || 1]]  SAID THAT [[THE [[FRENCH || 3]] AMBASSADOR IN [[DAMASCUS || 22]] || 23]]   HAD BEEN TOLD BY A [[SENIOR MEMBER OF THE [[PLO|| 25]] COUNCIL || 24]] THAT SOME SUCH SOLUTION, WITH RIGHT OF RETURN FOR EXPATRIATES, WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE. IN CONCLUSION [[HE || 1]]  EMPHASIZED THAT THE FUTURE OF [[EUROPE || 4]] AND WORLD PEACE DEPENDED ON A SETTLEMENT WHICH ONLY THE [[USG || 8]] COULD BRING ABOUT AND ASKED THAT [[HIS || 1]] VIEWS BE CONVEYED AGAIN TO [[THE SECRETARY || 16]].


6. [[SERVANT || 10]] INQUIRED WHETHER NEWS REPORTS OF AN [[ARAFAT || 26]] LETTER TO [[THE PRESIDENT  || 15]] WERE IN FACT CORRECT, AND [[THE CHARGE || 11]]  RESPONDED THAT [[THE EMBASSY || 14]] HAD NO INFORMATION ON THIS POINT.
