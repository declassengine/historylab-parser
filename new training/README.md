The training data format used by the History Lab parser is structured uniquely. The list of all entities along with their numbers is placed above the body in a text document. Each reference in the body is then surrounded by two square brackets ([[), the reference, a double pipe (||), the number of the reference and then two closing square brackets (]]).
The annotated data provided by TagWorks comes as a csv file with the starting and ending position of each annotated entity as well as the reference number.
